\section{Challenges and Future Directions}
\label{sec:future}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item multi-robot long-term localization and mapping
\item fusion of different sensors
\item availability of datasets in continuous operation in challenging long-term scenarios (urban, industry -- storage / logistics facilities)
\item edge/cloud computing
\item parameters of the algorithms adapting along time accordingly to changes in the environment
\item specific hardware for improving computational performance (FPGA, operating systems specific for real-time usage, etc.)
\item interaction with the user: map update and consequent visualization by the users not being on raw data but instead on higher levels of abstraction (CAD, automatic extract of the environment topological locations)
\item hierarchical localization and mapping (topological location > coarse localization > millimeter level of localization or  something like that)
\end{itemize}
