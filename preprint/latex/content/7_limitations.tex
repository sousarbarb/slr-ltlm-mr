\section{Limitations of the Study}
\label{sec:limitations}

Section to discuss possible limitations of the study (timeframe, wider approach, etc.).

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item only one query for discussion: e.g., for searching datasets, possibly, a different query should have been used
\item overview long-term SLAM vs in-depth analysis and discussion of each type of techniques: our review synthesizes all types of techniques, if the reader wants an in-depth analysis, different reviews should be performed
\item limited information on the experiments conditions (traveled distance, duration, etc.) given by the authors
\end{itemize}
