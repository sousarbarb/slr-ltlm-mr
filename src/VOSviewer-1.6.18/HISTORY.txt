  - Citation matching algorithm treats DOIs as case-sensitive when creating citation and bibliographic coupling maps.

1.6.4 -> 1.6.5 (September 26, 2016)
- An Overlay Visualization tab has been added to the main panel. This tab replaces the 'Score colors' and 'User defined colors' options available in the options panel when the Network Visualization tab is selected in the main panel. The 'No colors' option is no longer available in the options panel.
- Functionality for creating maps based on bibliographic data and based on text data has been improved and extended:
  - Duplicate records in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed files are automatically removed.

  - When creating a map of a citation network of documents, there can be only one citation link between two documents.
- Standardized weights have been introduced:
  - When a map has been created or a map and a network have been opened, two standardized weights are calculated for each item. One weight is the number of links of an item. The other weight is the total strength of the links of an item. The latter weight is not available when all links in a network have a strength of 1.
  - In the Weights drop down list in the options panel, the standardized weights are always listed above the user-defined weights. By default, the first user-defined weight is selected. If there are no user-defined weights, the total link strength weight is selected by default.
- A large number of command line parameters have been added. In particular, command line parameters have been added for saving maps and saving screenshots.
- A number of changes to the user interface have been made. The most important changes are:
  - Most of the functionality of the information panel has been transferred to the status bar. The information panel is no longer available if there are no item descriptions.

- Support has been added for creating maps based on RIS files.
- Functionality has been added for automatically determining the values of the attraction and repulsion parameters of the layout technique when creating a map. Co-authorship maps of authors, keyword co-occurrence maps, and citation maps of documents use values of, respectively, -1, 0, and 0 for the repulsion parameter. All other maps use a value of 1 for the repulsion parameter. The attraction parameter always has a value of 2.
- When creating a map based on bibliographic data, the default choice for the number of items has been set to 500. Previously, the default choice was to include all items.
- Optimization algorithm of the clustering technique has been improved based on the idea of 'fast local moving'.

- Default counting method for creating bibliographic coupling, co-citation, and co-authorship maps has been changed from fractional counting to full counting.
- Priority of cluster colors and score colors has been reversed. Cluster colors now have priority over score colors.

- A number of algorithmic changes have been made:
  - Data structure for storing networks has been changed. Networks are stored in a sparse format rather than in the full format that was used previously. This leads to a significant reduction in memory usage in the case of sparse networks.
  - Option has been added in the Advanced Parameters dialog box for using the LinLog/modularity normalization.
  - VOS mapping technique has been generalized. Two new parameters, the mapping attraction and the mapping repulsion, have been made available on the Map tab. Changing the values of these parameters may in some cases lead to more satisfactory mapping results.
  - Optimization algorithm of the VOS mapping technique has been changed. The majorization algorithm that was used previously has been replaced by a gradient descent algorithm. As a consequence, the Efficient Java Matrix Library is no longer needed. The mapping parameters available in the Advanced Parameters dialog box have been changed.
  - Default number of iterations of the optimization algorithm of the VOS clustering technique has been reduced from 50 to 10 in the Advanced Parameters dialog box. Clustering therefore takes less time.

- Various libraries (FreeHep VectorGraphics, Insubstantial, and SwingX) have been updated.
- A substantial number of bugs have been solved. Some of the more important bugs are:
  - URLs are incorrectly linked to items when there are multiple connected components and only the largest connected component is kept.
  - Null pointer exception in case of networks with unconnected items.
  - Cluster numbers starting at 0 rather than 1 in Pajek partition files.
