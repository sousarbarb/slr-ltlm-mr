Federico Boniardi studied Mathematics at the University of Milan and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. Currently, he is a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems of the University of Freiburg headed by Wolfram Burgard. His research interests include robot localization, mapping and navigation. Tim Caselitz is a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems of the University of Freiburg, which is headed by professor Wolfram Burgard. He received his diploma degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 2013. His research is focused on robotic perception using camera, RGB-D, and LiDAR sensors. Rainer Kümmerle is currently working as Product Owner at KUKA. He received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Freiburg in April 2013 where he was working in the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems of the University of Freiburg headed by Wolfram Burgard. His research interests lie in the areas of navigation, mapping, and localization. Wolfram Burgard is a professor for computer science at the University of Freiburg, Germany where he heads the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems. He received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Bonn in 1991. His areas of interest lie in artificial intelligence and mobile robots. In the past, Wolfram Burgard and his group developed several innovative probabilistic techniques for robot navigation and control. They cover different aspects such as localization, map building, path-planning, and exploration. For his work, Wolfram Burgard received several best paper awards from outstanding national and international conferences. In 2009, Wolfram Burgard received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, the most prestigious German research award. In 2010 he received the Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. Wolfram Burgard is the spokesperson of the Cluster of Excellence BrainLinksBrainTools and President of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.},

We thank the members of the CORAL group, in particular Brian Coltin, Stephanie Rosenthal, and Richard Wang, for the underlying robot task scheduling, human-robot interaction planning, and data-collection deployments. We also thank Mike Licitra for the design and construction of the CoBot robots. Joydeep Biswas is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Prior to joining UMass Amherst, Joydeep was a post-doctoral fellow in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and before that he earned his Ph.D. in Robotics from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. As a Ph.D. student he was the recipient of the 2015 Siebel Scholarship. See www.cs.umass.edu/ joydeepb/ for further details related to his research on autonomous service mobile robots. Manuela M. Veloso is the Herbert A. Simon University Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. She is the Incoming Head of the Machine Learning Department, and she has courtesy appointments in the Robotics Institute and Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. She researches in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Machine Learning. She founded and directs the CORAL research laboratory, for the study of autonomous agents that Collaborate, Observe, Reason, Act, and Learn, www.cs.cmu.edu/ coral . Professor Veloso is IEEE Fellow, AAAS Fellow, AAAI Fellow, and the past President of AAAI and RoboCup. Professor Veloso and her students research with a variety of autonomous robots, including mobile service robots and soccer robots.
