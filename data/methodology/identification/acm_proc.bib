  abstract = {Identifying request or task for assistance in an elderly or retirement home is a challenge for service robot. It is an essential task for service robot to give their services along with human. Identifying human position in an environment, such as elderly home, is the most challenging task, as it involves static and dynamic object. During its operation, a service robot must avoid collision to objects, and also prepares path for its journey. This work makes use of RGB-D camera, such as Kinect, to identify the static and dynamic object via 3D maps. To manage its path finding, the prediction of people location and position is enabled via Long Term and Short Term Memory been implemented in Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping. The loop closure detection with real time constraints wrapping the collected information that uses RGB-D SLAM method. To identify the human position and flow, a technique of pedestrian detection is added to find group of people, which will gain more understanding on how human will interact to robot. We have demonstrated the work of this initial work by generating 3D point cloud for specific environment through an intensive mapping experiments.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are expensive to run on smaller robotic platforms such as Micro-Aerial Vehicles. Bug algorithms are an alternative that use relatively little processing power, and avoid high memory consumption by not building an explicit map of the environment. In this work we explore the performance of Neuroevolution - specifically NEAT - at evolving control policies for simulated differential drive robots carrying out generalised maze navigation. We compare this performance with respect to one particular bug algorithm known as I-Bug. We extend NEAT to include Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to help deal with long term dependencies. We show that both NEAT and our NEAT-GRU can repeatably generate controllers that outperform I-Bug on a test set of 209 indoor maze like environments. We show that NEAT-GRU is superior to NEAT in this task. Moreover, we show that out of the 2 systems, only NEAT-GRU can continuously evolve successful controllers for a much harder task in which no bearing information about the target is provided to the agent.},

  abstract = {Vehicle navigation systems aim to reduce the mental workload for drivers by automating elements of the driving task. Concern has been raised, however, that their long-term use may cause unforeseen problems, including suppressing cognitive map development.A driving simulator study was conducted to discover if this effect could be ameliorated by the use of a novel, learning-oriented, navigation system. The user-interface of this system provided a range of additional features including landmarks, compass bearings and previously driven routes within the visual and auditory guidance instructions.It was found that the users of the learning-oriented system displayed better memory for driven routes, when compared with those using a basic guidance system. It is also suggested that they had developed a better cognitive map of the area. Glance analysis demonstrated that the learning-oriented system was no more visually demanding than the basic system.},

  abstract = {At present, mobile robots have been more and more widely used, in order to enable mobile robots to achieve autonomous localization and mapping (SLAM), and to solve the problem of cumulative errors caused by long-term movement of robots; The current mainstream filtering method does not solve the accumulated error caused by the mileage meter. In order to correct the accumulated error caused by the mileage meter, this design uses Cartographer algorithm to build the map, and correct the accumulated error of mileage to achieve the accurate positioning of the robot. Taking ROS system as the operating platform, the experimental results show that the mobile robot corrects the accumulated error of mileage very well, and achieves more accurate positioning and better environmental map construction.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the first step for enabling autonomous operation in unknown and changing environments. Many applications such as service and assistive robots require constant movement between different regions along with accurate navigation and localization at any point in time. Algorithms for SLAM have matured greatly over the last few years and can accommodate different sensors, computing requirements as well as environments for use. However, for long-term autonomy indoors, reasoning with a large volume of RGB-D data is still a major challenge. In this work, we propose a pipeline that attributes semantics, more specifically cuboidal structure, to observed objects, uses them as landmarks for mapping and thereby reduces the dimensionality of the represented map greatly. We chose cuboids, because many common urban scenes (such as offices, homes, malls) contain cuboidal objects (such as cabinets, tables, shelves). We develop a metric to perform such attribution consistently so they can be used as landmarks for mapping/navigation. We have tested our pipeline on three different datasets and show that we can reduce the map representation significantly while maintaining localization accuracy in all of them. Our vision is that attributing low-level semantics such as one presented in this work would make long-term autonomy computationally tractable.},
