In this paper, we tackle this problem by providing both theoretical analysis and algorithm design for robotic systems equipped with 2D laser range finders. The first key contribution of this paper is that we propose a hybrid signed distance field (SDF) framework for laser based localization. The proposed hybrid SDF integrates two methods with complementary characteristics, namely Euclidean SDF (ESDF) and Truncated SDF (TSDF). With our framework, accurate pose estimation and fast map update can be performed simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce a novel sliding window estimator which attains better accuracy by consistently utilizing sensor and map information with both scan-to-scan and scan-to-map data association. Real-world experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be used for commercial robots in various environments with long-term usage. Experiments also show that our approach outperforms competing approaches by a wide margin.","35","laser ranging - mobile robots - path planning - pose estimation - robot vision - sensor fusion - SLAM (robots)","robotic systems - 2D laser range finders - hybrid signed distance field framework - laser based localization - hybrid SDF - complementary characteristics - Euclidean SDF - fast map update - sensor - map information - scan-to-map data association - long-term usage - SDF-loc - 2D relocalization - dynamic environments - autonomous robot - long-term navigation - concurrent localization - theoretical analysis - scan-to-scan data association - pose estimation - signed distance field - truncated SDF - sliding window estimator","B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5260A Sensor fusion - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C3/00 - G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

It is challenging to perform a real-time onboard vision processing task, due to the strict payload capacity and power budget limitations of microflying vehicles. We propose a parallel onboard architecture that explicitly decouples the long-term positioning task into iteratively operated detection, tracking, and localization. The proposed approach is eventually called onboard detection-tracking-localization, namely oDTL. The detector automatically extracts and identifies the object from image frames captured at in-flight durations. A learning-based network is constructed to improve detection accuracy and robustness against ever-changing outdoor illumination conditions and flying viewpoints. The tracker follows the object within specified region-of-interest from frame to frame with lower computing consumption. To further reduce target-losing rate, a concept of blind zone is proposed and applied, and its boundaries in sequential images are also theoretically inferred. The position estimator maps the flying vehicle pose, the image coordinates, and calibration specifications into real-world positions of the moving target. An extended Kalman filter is developed for rough position estimation, and a smooth module is introduced for the refinement of the position. Three offline comparative experiments and three online experiments have been conducted respectively to testify the real-time capability of our approach. The collected experimental results also demonstrate the feasible accuracy and robustness of the overall solution within the specified flying onboard scenarios.","41","aerospace components - aircraft control - autonomous aerial vehicles - calibration - feature extraction - image capture - image sensors - image sequences - Kalman filters - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - nonlinear filters - object detection - position control - robot vision - target tracking","onboard detection-tracking-localization - monocular vision - miniature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle - vision processing task - strict payload capacity - power budget limitations - microflying vehicles - parallel onboard architecture - long-term positioning task - iteratively operated detection - image frames - robustness - outdoor illumination conditions - position estimator maps - flying vehicle - rough position estimation - learning-based network - image sequences - extended Kalman filter - region-of-interest","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B7230G Image sensors - C3360L Aerospace control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C1260S Signal processing theory - C3120C Spatial variables control - E2210 Mechanical components","B64C - B64C13/00 - B64C15/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - H01L27/146 - H04N5/30 - G06N5/04 - G06N20/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The ability to provide large-scale, long-term navigation using low-cost, low-power vision sensors is appealing for industrial applications. A crucial requirement for long-term navigation systems is the ability to localize in environments whose appearance is constantly changing over time-due to lighting, weather, seasons, and physical changes. This paper presents a multiexperience localization (MEL) system that uses a powerful map representation-storing every visual experience in layers-that does not make assumptions about underlying appearance modalities and generators. Our localization system provides real-time performance by selecting online, a subset of experiences against which to localize. We achieve this task through a novel experience-triage algorithm based on collaborative filtering, which selects experiences relevant to the live view, outperforming competing techniques. Based on classical memory-based recommender systems, this technique also enables landmark-level recommendations, is entirely online, and requires no training data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the MEL system in the context of long-term autonomous path following in unstructured outdoor environments with a challenging 100-day field experiment through day, night, snow, spring, and summer. We furthermore provide offline analysis comparing our system to several state-of-the-art alternatives. We show that the combination of the novel methods presented in this paper enable full use of incredibly rich multiexperience maps, opening the door to robust long-term visual localization.","45","cartography - image sensors - mobile robots - navigation - path planning - recommender systems - robot vision","map representation - visual experience storage - experience-triage algorithm - collaborative filtering - memory-based recommender systems - landmark-level recommendations - unstructured outdoor environments - multiexperience maps - long-term autonomous path - MEL system - appearance modalities - multiexperience localization system - long-term navigation systems - low-power vision sensors - autonomous mobile vehicles - visual navigation - long-term visual localization - selective memory","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C7210N Information networks - C7840 Geography and cartography computing - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - H01L27/146 - B60W30/095 - H04N21/466","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

While current state-of-the-art underwater navigation techniques are able to provide sufficient levels of precision in positioning, they require the use of support vessels or acoustic beacons. This can pose limitations on the size of the survey area, but also on the whole cost of the operations. Terrain Based Navigation is a sensor-based navigation technique that bounds the error growth of dead-reckoning using a map with terrain information, provided that there is enough terrain variability. An obvious advantage of Terrain Based Navigation is the fact that no external aiding signals or devices are required. Because of this unique feature, terrain navigation has the potential to dramatically improve the autonomy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). This paper consists on a comprehensive survey on the recent developments for Terrain Based Navigation methods proposed for AUVs. The survey includes a brief introduction to the original Terrain Based Navigation formulations, as well as a description of the algorithms, and a list of the different implementation alternatives found in the literature. Additionally, and due to the relevance, Bathymetric SLAM techniques will also be discussed.

The difficulty of this task is in the strong appearance changes that a place suffers due to dynamic elements, illumination, weather or seasons. In this paper, we propose a novel method (ABLE-M) to cope with the main problems of carrying out a robust visual topological localization along time. The novelty of our approach resides in the description of sequences of monocular images as binary codes, which are extracted from a global LDB descriptor and efficiently matched using FLANN for fast nearest neighbor search. Besides, an illumination invariant technique is applied. The usage of the proposed binary description and matching method provides a reduction of memory and computational costs, which is necessary for long-term performance. Our proposal is evaluated in different life-long navigation scenarios, where ABLE-M outperforms some of the main state-of-the-art algorithms, such as WI-SURF, BRIEF-Gist, FAB-MAP or SeqSLAM. Tests are presented for four public datasets where a same route is traversed at different times of day or night, along the months or across all four seasons.","29","binary codes - image matching - pattern classification - robot vision","life-long visual localization - binary sequences - image matching - robotics - ABLE-M - robust visual topological localization - binary codes - FLANN - fast nearest neighbor search","B6135E Image recognition - B6120B Codes - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1250 Pattern recognition","G06T - H03M","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state of the art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondence between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of approximately 25Hz.","25","human-robot interaction - image fusion - image segmentation - mobile robots - neural nets - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - user interfaces - video signal processing","SemanticFusion - dense 3D semantic mapping - convolutional neural networks - visual sensing mapping - mobile robots - robot intelligence - intuitive user interaction - simultaneous localisation and mapping system - SLAM system - ElasticFusion - indoor RGB-D video - loopy scanning trajectory - CNN semantic predictions - reconstruction dataset - single frame segmentation - baseline single frame predictions - 2D semantic labelling - multiple prediction fusion - NYUv2 dataset - multiple view points","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260A Sensor fusion - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5260D Video signal processing - C5290 Neural computing techniques - C6180R Human-robot interaction","B25J13/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

We present an algorithm for long-term localization and mapping in real time using a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner. The system infers the static or dynamic state of each 3D point in the environment based on repeated observations. The velocity of each dynamic point is estimated without requiring object models or explicit clustering of the points. At any time, the system is able to produce a most-likely representation of underlying static scene geometry. By storing the time history of velocities, we can infer the dominant motion patterns within the map. The result is an online mapping and localization system specifically designed to enable long-term autonomy within highly dynamic environments. We validate the approach using data collected around the campus of ETH Zurich over seven months and several kilometers of navigation.

However, the existing indoor sweep robot navigation algorithm has many problems; for instance, algorithm with high complexity demands high hardware performance and is incapable of working at night. To overcome those problems, in this paper, a new method for indoor robot Straight Line Movement via Navigator (SLMN) is proposed to ensure long linear motion of robot with an acceptable error threshold and realize multiroom navigation. Firstly, in a short time, robot runs a suitable distance when it is covered by navigator's ultrasonic sensor. We can obtain a triangle with twice the distance between navigator and robot and the distance of robot motion. The forward angle of the robot can be conveniently obtained by the trigonometric functions. Comparing the robot's current angle with expected angle, the robot could correct itself and realize the indoor linear navigation. Secondly, discovering dozens of the magnitude gaps between the distance of robot run and the distance between navigator and robot, we propose an optimized method using approximate scaling which increases efficiency by nearly 70.8%. Finally, to realize multiroom navigation, we introduce the conception of the depth-first search stack and a unique encode rule on rooms and navigators. It is proved by extensive quantitative evaluations that the proposed method realizes indoor full coverage at a lower cost than other state-of-the-art indoor vision navigation schemes, such as ORB-SLAM.","36","mobile robots - navigation - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","long linear motion - indoor robot Straight Line Movement - high complexity demands high hardware performance - existing indoor sweep robot navigation algorithm - long-term linear motion - state-of-the-art indoor vision navigation schemes - navigators - rooms - multiroom navigation - navigator - robot run - indoor linear navigation - robot motion","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Long-term visual place recognition is challenging underwater due to biofouling, corrosion, and other effects that lead to dramatic visual appearance change, which often causes traditional point-based feature methods to perform poorly. Building upon the authors' earlier work, this paper presents an algorithm for underwater vehicle place recognition and relocalization that enables an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to relocalize itself to a previously-built simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) graph. High-level structural features are learned using a supervised learning framework that retains features that have a high potential to persist in the underwater environment. Combined with a particle filtering framework, these features are used to provide a probabilistic representation of localization confidence. The algorithm is evaluated on real data, from multiple years, collected by a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) for ship hull inspection.","8","autonomous underwater vehicles - geophysical image processing - image recognition - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - oceanographic techniques - particle filtering (numerical methods) - probability - SLAM (robots)","ship hull inspection - HAUV - hovering autonomous underwater vehicle - probabilistic representation - particle filtering framework - supervised learning framework - high-level structural feature - SLAM graph - simultaneous localization and mapping graph - point-based feature method - biofouling - underwater robot visual place recognition","A9385 Instrumentation and techniques for geophysical, hydrospheric and lower atmosphere research - A0250 Probability theory, stochastic processes, and statistics - B7710D Oceanographic and hydrological techniques and equipment - B6135E Image recognition - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C7340 Geophysics computing - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C3390C Mobile robots - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01V - G05D1/00 - G06F15/18 - G06K9/00 - G06T - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR); Experimental (EXP)","Physics (A); Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Many Lunar robotics missions are planned in near future by different space agencies around the world. Moon has considered to be the best place for a research station with long-term human presence for finding answers on fundamental questions about the universe. Automatic navigation of starship during a landing phase on Lunar surface is already solved with a help of inertial reference system aided visual algorithms. However, questions of automatic navigation of moving and flying vehicles on the Lunar surface are still open. Inertial navigation is limited by time, self-localization and mapping algorithms require multiple unique features of relief to guarantee required accuracy for successful automatic mission complication. In the current study, we propose the deployment of a network of visual navigational aids on the Lunar surface to support ground automatic missions. A weak atmosphere of the Moon makes effective visual beacons navigation system for long areas. A network of navigational aids includes primary and secondary ground stations which are blinking synchronously. Synchronization is supported by radio waves from the primary ground station. We consider the nature of crater relief to increase operational area of the system. The Time Difference of Arrival method is used to detect vehicle position by blinking network of visual navigational aids. In the numerical application, we consider different scenarios of network configuration to support automatic vehicle navigation inside of Tycho crater. Also, deployment of visual navigational aids network will increase the number of optical features which improve performance of already used positioning methods.","0","aerospace robotics - inertial navigation - lunar surface - mobile robots - path planning - position control - robot vision - space vehicle navigation - synchronisation - time-of-arrival estimation","lunar surface - inertial reference system - visual algorithms - automatic navigation - inertial navigation - ground automatic missions - Moon exploration - automatic vehicle navigation - visual navigational aids network - long-term human presence - lunar robotics missions - automatic lunar mission - visual beacons navigation system - space agencies - starship - landing phase - flying vehicles - moving vehicles - self-localization and mapping - ground stations - synchronization - radio waves - time difference of arrival - vehicle position detection - network configuration - Tycho crater - optical features - positioning methods","B7690 Other topics in aerospace - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360L Aerospace control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","B64G1/00 - B64G3/00 - G01C21/24 - G01P7/00 - G01S - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095 - G01C21/16","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

While experience-based mapping has proven to be an effective technique for enabling visual localization across appearance change, the number of experiences required for reliable long-term localization can be large, and methods for reducing the necessary number of experiences are desired. Taking inspiration from physics-based models of color constancy, we propose a method for learning a nonlinear mapping from RGB to grayscale colorspaces that maximizes the number of feature matches for images captured under varying lighting and weather conditions. Our key insight is that useful image transformations can be learned by approximating conventional non-differentiable localization pipelines with a differentiable learned model that can predict a convenient measure of localization quality, such as the number of feature matches, for a given pair of images. Moreover, we find that the generality of appearance-robust RGB-to-grayscale mappings can be improved by incorporating a learned low-dimensional context feature computed for a specific image pair. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method substantially improves feature matching across day-night cycles and presents a viable strategy for significantly improving the efficiency of experience-based visual localization.","29","feature extraction - image colour analysis - image matching - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - robot vision","experience-based visual localization - matchable colorspace transformations - long-term metric localization - autonomous mobile robots - vision-based systems - appearance change - experience-based mapping - physics-based models - nonlinear mapping - weather conditions - nondifferentiable localization pipelines - differentiable learned model - localization quality - appearance-robust RGB-to-grayscale mappings - varying lighting conditions - image transformations - image pair - long-term metric visual localization - color constancy - grayscale colorspaces - RGB colorspaces - image feature matching - learned low-dimensional context feature","B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques","G05D1/00 - G06F15/18 - G06T - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for long-term localization using 3D LiDARs, coined PoseMap. In essence, we extract distinctive features from range measurements and bundle these into local views along with observation poses. The sensor's trajectory is then estimated in a sliding window fashion by matching current and old features and minimizing the distances in-between. The map representation facilitates finding a suitable set of old features, by selecting the closest local map(s) for matching. Similarly to a visibility analysis, this procedure provides a suitable set of features for localization but at a fraction of the computational cost. PoseMap also allows for updates and extensions of the map at any time by replacing and adding local maps when necessary. We evaluate our approach using two platforms both equipped with a 3D LiDAR and an IMU, demonstrating localization at 8 Hz and robustness to changes in the environment such as moving vehicles and changing vegetation. PoseMap was implemented on an autonomous vehicle allowing it to drive autonomously over a period of 18 months through a mix of industrial and unstructured off-road environments, covering more than 100 kms without a single localization failure.","21","feature extraction - mobile robots - optical radar - path planning","local views - sliding window fashion - matching current - old features - map representation - local maps - off-road environments - single localization failure - distinctive features - coined PoseMap - dynamic environments - robotic systems - long-term localization - multienvironment 3D LiDAR localization - frequency 8.0 Hz - time 18.0 month","B6320C Optical radar - B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots","G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

To enable a long-term VPR system on a large scale, several challenges need to be addressed. First, different applications could require different image view directions, such as front views for self-driving cars while side views for the low vision people. Second, VPR in metropolitan scenes can often cause privacy concerns due to the imaging of pedestrian and vehicle identity information, calling for the need for data anonymization before VPR queries and database construction. Both factors could lead to VPR performance variations that are not well understood yet. To study their influences, we present the NYU-VPR dataset that contains more than 200,000 images over a 2km×2km area near the New York University campus, taken within the whole year of 2016. We present benchmark results on several popular VPR algorithms showing that side views are significantly more challenging for current VPR methods while the influence of data anonymization is almost negligible, together with our hypothetical explanations and in-depth analysis.","0","data privacy - image recognition - road vehicles - visual databases","image view directions - pedestrian - metropolitan scenes - low vision people - long-term VPR system - visually impaired population - assistive navigation - autonomous driving vehicles - data anonymization influences - view direction - long-term visual place recognition benchmark - NYU-VPR dataset - VPR performance variations - VPR queries - vehicle identity information","B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6130S Data security - C6160S Spatial and pictorial databases","G06F21/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Traditional localization algorithms typically assume that the environment is static. However, in many real-world applications, such as parking lots and industrial plants, there are always dynamic objects (e.g. moving people) and semi-dynamic objects (e.g. parked cars and placed goods). In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a long-term localization algorithm in the environments which combine dynamic objects and semi-dynamic objects. Localizability-based-updating particle filter (LU-P F) algorithm is proposed here. Not only we use localizability matric to build an updating mechanism, but also it is used for localization system. Besides, we propose the dynamic factor as long-memory information to serve as prior knowledge, which improves the robustness of updating process. Experiments in parking lots demonstrate that our approach has better localization results with a more accurate up-to-date map compared to other methods.","18","mobile robots - particle filtering (numerical methods) - road traffic control","long-memory information - localizability-based-updating particle filter - long-term localization algorithm - dynamic changing environments - mobile robots - parking lots","C3390C Mobile robots - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C4130 Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis)","B60W - G05D1/00 - G08G1/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Global localization is of particular interest for real-world applications. If a robot would not be able to relocalize itself within a known map, all positions stored by the robot (rooms, objects, etc.) would become obsolete. Although Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows to initially map new and unknown environments and to keep track of environmental changes, it does not solve the global localization problem. Each time SLAM is restarted at different locations, it introduces a new map and a new frame of reference. In this paper, we propose a solution to the global localization problem which uses a SLAM generated feature map. The approach is demonstrated with an omnicam and bearing-only features. A new way to weight hypotheses and to sort out false hypotheses results in fast convergence even with arbitrary relocalization paths. The combined approach is a further step towards life-long operation of service robots and covers every part of a robot lifecycle, ranging from a setup via SLAM to efficient global localization for reuse of maps and object poses after restart.","24","mobile robots - path planning - robot vision - service robots - SLAM (robots)","multiple hypothesis tracking - service robots - simultaneous localization and mapping - global localization problem - SLAM - feature map","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7230G Image sensors - C3390C Mobile robots - C3120C Spatial variables control - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - H04N5/30 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Such poles are good candidates for reliable and long term landmarks even through difficult weather conditions or seasonal changes. To address the challenges of motion blur and illumination changes in railway scenarios we employ a Dynamic Vision Sensor, a novel event-based camera.

Conventional mapping methods such as grid maps can provide information for navigation, but they are not enough for complex environments that require interactions. On the other hand, high-definition (HD) mapping, which is mainly used in traffic networks, includes more information about an environment to perform excellent autonomous behaviour. In order to increase the efficiency of ATVs in flexible factories, an up-to-date environmental map information is required to perform successful long-term autonomous navigation. Therefore, when there exists a change in the environment, a simultaneous update of HD-map is as important as the creation of it. In this study, we propose an HD-map update methodology for ATVs that operates in smart factories. To the best of our knowledge, HD mapping has not been applied in smart factories. The proposed method includes the object detection and localisation tool to detect objects visually and determines their positions in connection with the conventional maps of the environment. Experimental results of a simulated factory environment demonstrate that the ATV can properly update the HD-map when a predefined sign is removed from or a new sign is added to the environment.","51","factory automation - industrial robots - mobile robots - object detection - path planning - production engineering computing - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","object detection - autonomous navigation - up-to-date environmental map information - Industry 4.0 - context-aware structured smart factories - intelligent autonomous transfer vehicles - high-definition map update framework - HD mapping - ATV","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C7480 Production engineering computing - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3350 Control in industrial production systems - C3355 Control applications in manufacturing processes - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - E1510 Manufacturing systems - E1550A Robotics - E0410D Industrial applications of IT","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

One of the main challenges is the accurate localization of both vehicles and trees in a forest. Forests are unstructured environments where it is difficult to find a group of significant landmarks for current fast feature-based place recognition algorithms. This paper proposes a novel approach where local point clouds are matched to a global tree map using the Delaunay triangularization as the representation format. Instead of point cloud based matching methods, we utilize a topology-based method. First, tree trunk positions are registered at a prior run done by a forest harvester. Second, the resulting map is Delaunay triangularized. Third, a local submap of the autonomous robot is registered, triangularized and matched using triangular similarity maximization to estimate the position of the robot. We test our method on a dataset accumulated from a forestry site at Lieksa, Finland. A total length of 200m of harvester path was recorded by an industrial harvester with a 3D laser scanner and a geolocation unit fixed to the frame. Our experiments show a 12 cm s.t.d. in the location accuracy and with real-time data processing for speeds not exceeding 0.5 m/s.

Global localization module processes the global map to obtain the map pyramid, thus improve the global localization speed and accuracy when robots are powered on or kidnapped. Laser and artificial landmark-based localization module is employed to achieve robust localization in highly dynamic scenes and high-precision localization in target areas.

We show that semantically labeled 3D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.), Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time.","22","feature extraction - image segmentation - particle filtering (numerical methods) - transforms","particle filter based semantic localization solution - SIFT-features - vehicle localization - semantically labeled 3D point maps - autonomous vehicles - long-term visual navigation - robust cross-seasonal localization - semantically segmented images - long-term visual localization - image segmenter - hand-crafted feature descriptors","B6135E Image recognition - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0230 Integral transforms - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1130 Integral transforms","G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This is a critical component of autonomous vehicles or robots on the road for handling localization failures. In this paper, based on reduced dimension scan representations learned from neural networks, a solution to global localization is proposed by achieving place recognition first and then metric pose estimation in the global prior map. Specifically, we present a semi-handcrafted feature learning method for 3D Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds using artificial statistics and siamese network, which transforms the place recognition problem into a similarity modeling problem. Additionally, the sensor data using dimension reduced representations require less storage space and make the searching easier. With the learned representations by networks and the global poses, a prior map is built and used in the localization framework. In the localization step, position only observations obtained by place recognition are used in a particle filter algorithm to achieve precise pose estimation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our place recognition and localization approach, KITTI benchmark and our multi-session datasets are employed for comparison with other geometric-based algorithms. The results show that our system can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency for long-term autonomy.","38","feature extraction - image filtering - image representation - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - neural nets - optical radar - particle filtering (numerical methods) - pose estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","3D point clouds - mobile vehicles - outdoor scenarios - autonomous vehicles - localization failures - reduced dimension scan representations - neural networks - global prior map - feature learning method - 3D light detection - siamese network - place recognition problem - similarity modeling problem - dimension reduced representations - learned representations - global poses - localization framework - localization step - localization approach - 3D LiDAR-based global localization - siamese neural network","B6320C Optical radar - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - B6135E Image recognition - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing","G01S17/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - G06N20/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This problem is called place recognition. In recent years, LiDAR scan based place recognition has drawn attention as it is robust against the appearance change. In this letter, we propose a LiDAR-based place recognition method, named Differentiable Scan Context with Orientation (DiSCO), which simultaneously finds the scan at a similar place and estimates their relative orientation. The orientation can further be used as the initial value for the down-stream local optimal metric pose estimation, improving the pose estimation especially when a large orientation between the current scan and retrieved scan exists. Our key idea is to transform the feature into the frequency domain. We utilize the magnitude of the spectrum as the place descriptor, which is theoretically rotation-invariant. In addition, based on the differentiable phase correlation, we can efficiently estimate the global optimal relative orientation using the spectrum. With such structural constraints, the network can be learned in an end-to-end manner, and the backbone is fully shared by the two tasks, achieving better interpretability and lightweight. Finally, DiSCO is validated on three datasets with long-term outdoor conditions, showing better performance than the compared methods.

To achieve these objectives, algorithm design choices for the software developments need to be tested and validated for expected scenarios such as autonomous in situ resource utilization, localization in challenging environments, and multirobot coordination. However, real-world experiments are extremely challenging and limited for extraterrestrial environment. Also, realistic simulation demonstrations in these environments are still rare and demanded for initial algorithm testing capabilities. To help some of these needs, the NASA Centennial Challenges program established the Space Robotics Challenge Phase 2 (SRC2), which consist of virtual robotic systems in a realistic lunar simulation environment, where a group of mobile robots were tasked with reporting volatile locations within a global map, excavating and transporting these resources, and detecting and localizing a target of interest. The main goal of this article is to share our team's experiences on the design tradeoffs to perform autonomous robotic operations in a virtual lunar environment and to share strategies to complete the mission requirements posed by NASA SRC2 competition during the qualification round.

Many previous approaches to mapping assume a static world. In this work we incorporate the time dimension into the mapping process to enable a robot to maintain an accurate map while operating in dynamical environments. This paper presents Dynamic Pose Graph SLAM (DPG-SLAM), an algorithm designed to enable a robot to remain localized in an environment that changes substantially over time. Using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) as the underlying SLAM state estimation engine, the Dynamic Pose Graph evolves over time as the robot explores new places and revisits previously mapped areas. The approach has been implemented for planar indoor environments, using laser scan matching to derive constraints for SLAM state estimation. Laser scans for the same portion of the environment at different times are compared to perform change detection; when sufficient change has occurred in a location, the dynamic pose graph is edited to remove old poses and scans that no longer match the current state of the world. Experimental results are shown for two real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets, demonstrating the ability to maintain an up-to-date map despite long-term environmental changes.","19","laser beam applications - mobile robots - optical scanners - SLAM (robots) - state estimation","long-term mapping - low dynamic environments - environment map maintenance - autonomous mobile robots - dynamical environments - dynamic pose graph SLAM - DPG-SLAM - incremental smoothing and mapping - iSAM - SLAM state estimation engine - planar indoor environments - laser scan matching - change detection - real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets","C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","H04N1/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2013, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The main problem we faced is the question of how to describe a scene discriminatively and compactly-both of which are necessary in order to cope with changes in appearance and a large amount of visual information. In this study, we address the above issues by mining visual experience. Our strategy is to mine a library of raw visual images, termed visual experience, to find the relevant visual patterns to effectively explain the input scene. From a practical point of view, our work offers three main contributions over the previous work. First, it is the first application of discriminative visual features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to the task of visual landmark mining. Second, we show how to interpret a high-dimensional DCNN feature to a compact semantic representation of visual word. Third, we show that our approach can turn the scene description task with any feature (including the DCNN feature) into the task of mining visual experience. Experiments on a challenging cross-domain visual place recognition validate efficacy of the proposed approach.","30","data mining - feedforward neural nets - object recognition - SLAM (robots)","DCNN landmarks mining - visual SLAM - discriminative visual features - deep convolutional neural networks - visual landmark mining - visual word semantic representation - cross-domain visual place recognition","B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6130 Data handling techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C5290 Neural computing techniques","G06F7/00 - G06F15/18 - G06T - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Episodic non-Markov Localization addresses the challenge of localization in such changing environments by classifying observations as arising from Long-Term, Short-Term, or Dynamic Features. However, in order to do so, EnML relies on an estimate of the Long-Term Vector Map (LTVM) that does not change over time. In this paper, we introduce a recursive algorithm to build and update the LTVM over time by reasoning about visibility constraints of objects observed over multiple robot deployments. We use a signed distance function (SDF) to filter out observations of short-term and dynamic features from multiple deployments of the robot. The remaining long-term observations are used to build a vector map by robust local linear regression. The uncertainty in the resulting LTVM is computed via Monte Carlo resampling the observations arising from long-term features. By combining occupancy-grid based SDF filtering of observations with continuous space regression of the filtered observations, our proposed approach builds, updates, and amends LTVMs over time, reasoning about all observations from all robot deployments in an environment. We present experimental results demonstrating the accuracy, robustness, and compact nature of the extracted LTVMs from several long-term robot datasets.","20","mobile robots - Monte Carlo methods - multi-robot systems - regression analysis - service robots - vectors","long-term vector maps curating - LTVM - recursive algorithm - visibility constraints - multiple robot deployments - signed distance function - SDF - short-term features - dynamic features - robust local linear regression - Monte Carlo resampling - occupancy-grid based SDF filtering - continuous space regression - autonomous service mobile robots","C3390C Mobile robots - C1110 Algebra - C1140G Monte Carlo methods","G05D1/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

These techniques heavily rely on robust and reliable feature-based vision front ends. The job of a vision front end is to provide correspondence information between different camera views which is then directly fed into a bundle adjustment step. Although the atomic steps involved in constructing a vision front end are well-known, many of the popular choices of the features and their parameters do not perform reliably in a variety of visually degraded underwater and polar environments that are characterized by low texture and contrast, and by unevenly lit and low-overlap imagery. In this paper, we develop novel metrics and quantitative analysis methods which can measure the impact of image pre-processing steps such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) on the improvement of vision front-end outputs. Our metrics and quantitative analysis can guide the selection between different feature detectors and descriptors to develop a reliable and robust vision front end that can operate in a wider range of underwater and polar environments. We showcase how CLAHE improves the saliency of features and feature track length on a visually degraded dataset underwater, resulting in a substantial increase in correspondence information for the SfM solution.

Association is solved efficiently by applying distance transform on binary per-class images. This provides not only a fast lookup table for a smooth gradient as needed for pose-graph optimization, but also dynamic association by default.A sliding-window pose graph optimization combines single image detections with vehicle odometry, smoothing results and helping overcome even misclassifications in consecutive frames.Evaluation against a highly accurate 6D visual localization shows that our approach can achieve accuracy levels as required for automated driving, being one of the most lightweight and flexible methods to do so.","29","cameras - computer vision - distance measurement - feature extraction - graph theory - image segmentation - image sensors - mobile robots - object detection - optimisation - pose estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - table lookup","monocular localization - HD map - semantic segmentation - distance transform - long-term localization - open topic - dense maps - expensive sensors - specialized map features - proprietary detectors - monocular camera - automated driving - powerful HD maps - monocular vision - data association - binary per-class images - pose-graph optimization - dynamic association - highly accurate 6D visual localization - lightweight methods - flexible methods","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6135E Image recognition - B7230G Image sensors - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390C Mobile robots","G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - H01L27/146 - H04N5/30","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In this task, vehicles need to navigate in narrow, crowded and GPS-denied parking lots. Accurate localization ability is of great importance. Traditional visual-based methods suffer from tracking lost due to texture-less regions, repeated structures, and appearance changes. In this paper, we exploit robust semantic features to build the map and localize vehicles in parking lots. Semantic features contain guide signs, parking lines, speed bumps, etc, which typically appear in parking lots. Compared with traditional features, these semantic features are long-term stable and robust to the perspective and illumination change. We adopt four surround-view cameras to increase the perception range. Assisting by an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and wheel encoders, the proposed system generates a global visual semantic map. This map is further used to localize vehicles at the centimeter level. We analyze the accuracy and recall of our system and compare it against other methods in real experiments.

However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform. Additionally, repeated visits to locations will develop multiple competing representations, which will reduce recall performance over time. These properties impose severe restrictions on long-term autonomy for mobile robots, as loop closure performance will inevitably degrade with increased operation time. In this paper we present a graphical extension to CAT-SLAM, a particle filter-based algorithm for appearance-based localization and mapping, to provide constant computation and memory requirements over time and minimal degradation of recall performance during repeated visits to locations. We demonstrate loop closure detection in a large urban environment with capped computation time and memory requirements and performance exceeding previous appearance-based methods by a factor of 2.

Each robot is equipped with a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and has the ability to communicate with its neighbors. Rather than assuming a known common global frame for all the robots (which is often the case in the literature regarding multi-robot systems), we allow each robot to perform motion estimation locally. For localization, we propose a multi-robot visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) where one robot builds a prior map and then the map is used to bound the long-term drifts of the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) running on the other robots.

While experience-based mapping has proven to be an effective technique for bridging the `appearance gap,' the number of experiences required for reliable metric localization over days or months can be very large, and methods for reducing the necessary number of experiences are needed for this approach to scale. Taking inspiration from color constancy theory, we learn a nonlinear RGB-to-grayscale mapping that explicitly maximizes the number of inlier feature matches for images captured under different lighting and weather conditions, and use it as a pre-processing step in a conventional single-experience localization pipeline to improve its robustness to appearance change. We train this mapping by approximating the target non-differentiable localization pipeline with a deep neural network, and find that incorporating a learned low-dimensional context feature can further improve cross-appearance feature matching. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in localization performance across day-night cycles, enabling continuous metric localization over a 30-hour period using a single mapping experience, and allowing experience-based localization to scale to long deployments with dramatically reduced data requirements.","40","feature extraction - image colour analysis - image matching - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - neural nets - object recognition - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","matchable image transformations - long-term metric visual localization - long-term metric self-localization - autonomous mobile robots - vision-based systems - appearance change - seasonal variations - experience-based mapping - appearance gap - reliable metric localization - color constancy theory - RGB-to-grayscale mapping - inlier feature - weather conditions - single-experience localization pipeline - target nondifferentiable localization pipeline - low-dimensional context feature - cross-appearance feature matching - localization performance - day-night cycles - continuous metric localization - single mapping experience - experience-based localization - dramatically reduced data requirements","B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5290 Neural computing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques","G05D1/00 - G06T - G06N5/04 - G06N20/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Sensor observations are compared by a similarity metric to detect loops. In long term navigation or exploration, the number of observations increases and so the complexity of the loop closure detection. Several techniques are proposed in order to reduce the complexity of loop closure detection. Few algorithms have considered the loop closure detection from a subset of sensor observations. In this paper, the compressed sensing approach is exploited to detect loops from few sensor measurements. In the basic compressed sensing it is assumed that a signal has a sparse representation is a basis which means that only a few elements of the signal are non-zero. Based on the compressed sensing approach a sparse signal can be recovered from few linear noisy projections by l1 minimization. The difference matrix which is widely used for loop detection has a sparse structure, where similar observations are shown by zero distance and different locations are indicated by ones. Based on the multiple measurement vector technique which is an extension of the basic compressed sensing, the loop closure detection is performed by comparison of few sensor observations. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is investigated in some outdoor environments through some publicly available data sets. It has been shown by some experiments that the proposed method can detect loops effectively.","29","compressed sensing - matrix algebra - mobile robots - object detection - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","loop closure detection - compressed sensing - mobile robots - SLAM - simultaneously localization and mapping - sensor observation - sensor measurement - signal representation - difference matrix - l1 minimization","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0210 Algebra - C3390C Mobile robots - C1110 Algebra - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Moreover, they have to do it at faster speeds than conventional mobile robots. This paper reports on an efficient technique to optimize the position of a sequence of maps along a journey. We take advantage of the short-term precision and reduced space on disk of the localization using 2D occupancy grid maps, from now on called sub-maps, as well as, the long-term global consistency of a Kalman filter that fuses odometry and GPS measurements. In our approach, horizontal planar LiDARs and odometry measurements are used to perform 2D-SLAM generating the sub-maps, and the EKF to generate the trajectory followed by the car in global coordinates. During the trip, after finishing each sub-map, a relaxation process is applied to a set of the last sub-maps to position them globally using both, global and map's local path. The importance of this method lies on its performance, expending low computing resources, so it can work in real time on a computer with conventional characteristics and on its robustness which makes it suitable for being used on a self-driving car as it doesn't depend excessively on the availability of GPS signal or the eventual appearance of moving objects around the car. Extensive testing has been performed in the suburbs and in the down-town of Nantes (France) covering a distance of 25 kilometers with different traffic conditions obtaining satisfactory results for autonomous driving.","9","cartography - control engineering computing - distance measurement - Global Positioning System - Kalman filters - mobile robots - optical radar - optimisation - road vehicles","autonomous driving - GPS signal - computing resource - relaxation process - EKF - 2D-SLAM - odometry measurement - horizontal planar LiDAR - GPS measurement - Kalman filter - long-term global consistency - 2D occupancy grid map - reduced space - short-term precision - mobile robot - self-driving car autonomous navigation - positioning multiple map - optimization technique","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260 Digital signal processing - C1180 Optimisation techniques","B60W - G01B - G01S - G05D1/00 - G08G1/00 - G01T1/10","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This is done by identifying which subset of the parameter space is rendered observable with a rank-revealing decomposition of the Fisher information matrix, modeling calibration as a Markov decision process and using reinforcement learning to establish which discrete sequence of motions optimizes for the regression of the desired parameters. The goal is to address the assumption common to most calibration solutions: that sufficiently informative motions are provided by the operator. We do not make use of a process model and instead leverage an experience-based approach that is broadly applicable to any platform in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping. This is a step in the direction of long-term autonomy and ldquopower-on-and-gordquo robotic systems, making repeatable and reliable calibration accessible to the non-expert operator.","40","calibration - cameras - inertial navigation - learning (artificial intelligence) - Markov processes - mobile robots - nonlinear filters - SLAM (robots)","experience-based approach - repeatable calibration - reliable calibration - guided calibration - visual-inertial rigs - assisted intrinsic calibration - extrinsic calibration - observability-aware visual-inertial calibration system - calibration procedure - render - calibration parameters - parameter space - rank-revealing decomposition - Fisher information matrix - Markov decision process - using reinforcement learning - motions optimizes - desired parameters - calibration solutions - sufficiently informative motions - process model","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7130 Measurement standards and calibration - B7230G Image sensors - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques","G01D18/00 - G01P7/00 - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T - G12B13/00 - H04N5/30 - G01C21/16 - G06N5/04 - G06N20/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The existing approaches require expensive high-density laser range finders and suffer from relocalization problems in long-term applications. This study proposes a novel map format called the ClusterMap, on the basis of which an approach to achieving relocalization is developed. The ClusterMap is generated by segmenting the perceived point clouds into different point clusters and filtering out clusters belonging to dynamic objects. A location descriptor associated with each cluster is designed for differentiation. The relocalization in the global map is achieved by matching cluster descriptors between local and global maps. The solution does not require high-density point clouds and high-precision segmentation algorithms. In addition, it prevents the effects of environmental changes on illumination intensity, object appearance, and observation direction. A consistent ClusterMap without any scale problem is built by utilizing a 3D visual-LIDAR simultaneous localization and mapping solution by fusing LIDAR and visual information. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and our mobile vehicle illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","34","image segmentation - laser ranging - mobile robots - optical radar - path planning - pattern clustering - remotely operated vehicles - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","ClusterMap building - urban environments - unmanned vehicles - map building - map-based relocalization techniques - high-density laser range finders - relocalization problems - long-term applications - map format - perceived point clouds - point clusters - dynamic objects - location descriptor - cluster descriptors - local maps - global maps - high-density point clouds - high-precision segmentation algorithms - consistent ClusterMap - scale problem - mapping solution - mobile vehicle - 3D visual-LIDAR simultaneous localization and mapping solution - visual information - KITTI dataset","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6320C Optical radar - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C3/00 - G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo camera based visual localization method using a modified laser map, which takes the advantage of both the low cost of camera, and high geometric precision of laser data to achieve long-term performance. Considering that LiDAR and camera give measurements of the same environment in different modalities, the cross-modal invariance is investigated to modify the laser map for visual localization. Specifically, a map learning algorithm is introduced to sample the robust subsets in laser maps that are useful for visual localization using multi-session visual and laser data. Further, a generative map model is derived to describe this cross-modal invariance, based on which two types of measurements are defined to model the laser map points as appropriate visual observations. Tightly coupling these measurements within the local bundle adjustment during online sliding-window based visual odometry, the vehicle can achieve robust localization even one year after the map was built. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both the public KITTI datasets and self-collected datasets in our campus, which include seasonal, illumination and object variations. On all experimental localization sessions, our method provides satisfactory results, even when the direction is opposite to that in the mapping session, verifying the superior performance of the laser map based visual localization method.","57","cameras - distance measurement - invariance - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - path planning - road traffic control - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - stereo image processing - traffic engineering computing","persistent stereo visual localization - cross-modal invariant map - autonomous mobile vehicles - low-cost equipment - stereo camera - laser data - cross-modal invariance - map learning algorithm - multisession visual - generative map model - laser map points - local bundle adjustment - online sliding-window based visual odometry - public KITTI datasets - self-collected datasets","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C7420 Control engineering computing - C7445 Traffic engineering computing - C3120C Spatial variables control","B60W - G01B - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05B15/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - G08G1/00 - H04N13/00 - B60W30/095 - G06N5/04 - G06N20/00","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Proper ventilation is often crucial for preventing accidents, such as explosions in mines and avoiding health issues, for example, through long-term exposure to harmful respirable matter. Validation and maintenance of ventilation systems is thus of key interest for plant operators and authorities. However, methods for ventilation characterization, which allow us to monitor whether the ventilation system in place works as desired, hardly exist. This article addresses the critical challenge of ventilation characterization-measuring and modelling air flow at micro-scales-that is, creating a high-resolution model of wind speed and direction from airflow measurements. Models of the near-surface micro-scale flow fields are not only useful for ventilation characterization, but they also provide critical information for planning energy-efficient paths for aerial robots and many applications in mobile robot olfaction. In this article we propose a heterogeneous measurement system composed of static, continuously sampling sensing nodes, complemented by localized measurements, collected during occasional sensing missions with a mobile robot. We introduce a novel, data-driven, multi-domain airflow modelling algorithm that estimates (1) fields of posterior distributions over wind direction and speed (ldquoventilation mapsrdquo, spatial domain); (2) sets of ventilation calendars that capture the evolution of important airflow characteristics at measurement positions (temporal domain); and (3) a frequency domain analysis that can reveal periodic changes of airflow in the environment. The ventilation map and the ventilation calendars make use of an improved estimation pipeline that incorporates a wind sensor model and a transition model to better filter out sporadic, noisy airflow changes. These sudden changes may originate from turbulence or irregular activity in the surveyed environment and can, therefore, disturb modelling of the relevant airflow patterns. We tested the proposed multi-domain airflow modelling approach with simulated data and with experiments in a semi-controlled environment and present results that verify the accuracy of our approach and its sensitivity to different turbulence levels and other disturbances. Finally, we deployed the proposed system in two different real-world industrial environments (foundry halls) with different ventilation regimes for three weeks during full operation. Since airflow ground truth cannot be obtained, we present a qualitative discussion of the generated airflow models with plant operators, who concluded that the computed models accurately depicted the expected airflow patterns and are useful to understand how pollutants spread in the work environment. This analysis may then provide the basis for decisions about corrective actions to avoid long-term exposure of workers to harmful respirable matter.","35","chemioception - computerised instrumentation - flow measurement - flow sensors - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - ventilation","high-resolution model - airflow measurements - microscale flow fields - mobile robot olfaction - heterogeneous measurement system - localized measurements - ventilation map - spatial domain analysis - ventilation calendars - measurement positions - temporal domain - frequency domain analysis - wind sensor model - transition model - sporadic airflow changes - noisy airflow changes - generated airflow models - plant operators - computed models - expected airflow patterns - harmful respirable matter - multidomain airflow modeling - stationary sensors - ventilation system characterization - airflow ground truth patterns - air flow modelling - mobile robot - machine learning","A4780 Measurement instrumentation and techniques for fluid dynamics - A8738 Mechano- and chemio-ceptions - A0670D Sensing and detecting devices - B7320W Level, flow and volume measurement - B7210B Computerised instrumentation - B7230 Sensing devices and transducers - C7410H Computerised instrumentation - C3390C Mobile robots - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques","F24F7/00 - G01F - G05D1/00 - G06N5/04 - G06N20/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Physics (A); Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Most commercial systems for MAVs currently fuse GPS measurements with IMU information to navigate the MAV. However there are many scenarios in which an MAV might prove useful, but GPS is not available (e.g., indoors, urban terrain, etc.). Therefore several approaches have recently been introduced that couple information from an IMU with visual information (usually captured by an electro-optical camera). In general the methods for fusing visual information with an IMU utilizes one of two techniques: 1) applying rigid body constraints on where landmarks should appear in a set of two images (constraint-based fusion) or 2) simultaneously estimating the location of features that are observed by the camera (mapping) and the location of the camera (simultaneous localization and mapping-SLAM-based fusion). While each technique has some nuances associated with its implementation in a true MAV environment (i.e., computational requirements, real-time implementation, feature tracking, etc.), this paper focuses solely on answering the question 'Which fusion technique (constraint- or SLAM-based) enables more accurate long-term MAV navigation?' To answer this question, specific implementations of a constraint- and SLAM-based fusion technique, with novel modifications for improved results on MAVs, are described. A basic simulation environment is used to perform a comparison of the constraint- and SLAM-based fusion methods. We demonstrate the superiority of SLAM-based techniques in specific MAV flight scenarios and discuss the relative weaknesses and strengths of each fusion approach.","30","aircraft - cameras - data visualisation - Global Positioning System - image fusion - mobile robots - remotely operated vehicles - SLAM (robots)","image comparison - inertial sensor fusion technique - unmapped environment - miniature aerial vehicle - inertial measurement unit - commercial system - GPS measurement - IMU information - visual information - constraint based fusion - simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM based fusion","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B7230G Image sensors - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360L Aerospace control - C5260A Sensor fusion - C7460 Aerospace engineering computing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics","B64C - G01S - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T - H04N5/30 - G01T1/10","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The proposed method relies strictly on onboard sensors of employed MAVs and does not require any external positioning system. The core of the method consists in extraction of information from pictures consequently captured using a camera carried by the particular MAV. Visual features are obtained from images of the surface under the MAV, and stored into a map that is represented by these features. The position of the MAV is then obtained through matching with previously stored features. An important part of the proposed system is a novel approach for exploration and mapping of the workspace of robots. This method enables efficient exploring of the unknown environment, while keeping the iteratively built map of features consistent. The proposed algorithm is suitable for mapping of surfaces, both outdoor and indoor, with various density of the image features. The sufficient precision and long term persistence of the method allows its utilization for stabilization of large MAV groups that work in formations with small relative distances between particular vehicles.

Outdated maps however are a risk to the performance of any map-based localization system applied in autonomous vehicles. It is necessary to update the used maps to ensure stable and long-term operation. We address the problem of computing landmark updates live in the vehicle, which requires efficient use of the computational resources. In particular, we employ a graph-based sliding window approach for simultaneous localization and incremental map refinement. We propose a novel method that approximates sliding window marginalization without inducing fill-in. Our method maintains the exact same sparsity pattern as without performing marginalization, but simultaneously improves the landmark estimates. The main novelty of this work is the derivation of sparse global priors that approximate dense marginalization. In comparison to state-of-the-art work, our approach utilizes global instead of local linearization points, but still minimizes linearization errors. We first approximate marginalization via Kullback-Leibler divergence and then recalculate the mean to compensate linearization errors. We evaluate our approach on simulated and real data from a prototype vehicle and compare our approach to state-of-the-art sliding window marginalization.","28","approximation theory - error compensation - graph theory - mobile robots - object detection - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","linearization error compensation - Kullback-Leibler divergence - graph-based sliding window approach - sliding window marginalization - sliding window SLAM-graphs - linearization error minimization - landmark updates - long-term operation - map-based localization system - outdated maps - autonomous vehicles - prototype vehicle - local linearization points - approximate dense marginalization - sparse global priors - landmark estimates - exact same sparsity pattern - incremental map refinement - simultaneous localization - computational resources","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0290F Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - C3390C Mobile robots - C4130 Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations - which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources. We demonstrate and evaluate our system over three challenging datasets, totalling 206km of outdoor travel. We demonstrate the system in a diverse range of lighting and weather conditions, scene clutter, camera occlusions, and permanent structural change in the environment.","19","environmental factors - probability - robots","time-constrained localisation - vast-scale localisation - scene structure - lighting structure - weather structure - visual map - experience-based navigation - visual memory - cyclic appearance change - diurnal lighting - seasonal changes - extreme weather conditions - experience-map - memory policy - localisation efficiency - long-term autonomy - robots - probabilistic way - computational resources - scene clutter - camera occlusions - permanent structural change","C3310 Natural resources and environmental control - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C3390 Robotics","","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In this paper, we propose a highly compressed representation for LiDAR maps, along with an efficient and robust real-time alignment algorithm for on-vehicle LiDAR scans. The proposed mapping framework, which we refer to as Feature Likelihood Acquisition Map Emulation (FLAME), requires less than 0.1% of the storage space of the original 3D point cloud map. In essence, FLAME emulates an original map through feature likelihood functions. In particular, FLAME models planar, pole and curb features. These three feature classes are long-term stable, distinct and common among vehicular roadways. Multiclass feature points are extracted from LiDAR scans through feature detection. A new multiclass-based point-to-distribution alignment method is proposed to find the association and alignment between the multiclass feature points and the FLAME map. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve the same level of accuracy (less than 10cm) as the 3D point cloud based localization.","35","feature extraction - mobile robots - object detection - optical radar - path planning - road vehicles - robot vision","feature likelihood acquisition map emulation - 3D point-cloud-based maps - feature-likelihood based mapping - 3D point cloud based localization - FLAME map - multiclass-based point-to-distribution alignment method - feature detection - multiclass feature points - feature likelihood functions - storage space - on-vehicle LiDAR scans - real-time alignment algorithm - LiDAR maps - city-scale environments - transmission burdens - autonomous vehicle navigation - vehicle localization","B6320C Optical radar - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","B60W - G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - G08G1/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

These methods assume Markov independence of observations, implying that the observations can be entirely explained by a map. However, in real human environments, robots frequently make unexpected observations due to unmapped static objects like chairs and tables, and dynamic objects like humans. We therefore introduce Episodic non-Markov Localization (EnML), which reasons about the world as consisting of three classes of objects: long-term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects, short-term features corresponding to unmapped static objects, and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects. Long-term features are represented by a static map, while short-term features are detected and tracked in real-time. To reason about unexpected observations and their correlations across poses, we augment the Dynamic Bayesian Network for Markov localization to include varying edges and nodes, resulting in a novel Varying Graphical Network representation. The maximum likelihood estimate of the belief is incrementally computed by non-linear functional optimization. By detecting timesteps along the robot's trajectory where unmapped observations prior to such time steps are unrelated to those afterwards, EnML limits the history of observations and pose estimates to “episodes” over which the belief is computed. We demonstrate EnML using different types of sensors including laser rangefinders and depth cameras, and over multiple datasets, comparing it with alternative approaches. We further include results of a team of indoor autonomous service mobile robots traversing hundreds of kilometers using EnML.

The proposed ArUco mapping algorithm can build and correct the map of markers online with Grubbs criterion and K-mean clustering, which avoids the map distortion due to lack of correction. Based on the conception of multi-sensor information fusion, the federated Kalman filter is utilized to synthesize the multi-source information from markers, optical flow, ultrasonic and the inertial sensor, which can obtain a continuous localization result and effectively reduce the position drift due to the long-term loss of markers in pure marker localization. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in a hardware of one Raspberry Pi Zero and two STM32 micro controllers produced by STMicroelectronics (Geneva, Switzerland). Thus, a small-size and low-cost marker-based localization system is presented. The experimental results show that the speed estimation result of the proposed system is better than Px4flow, and it has the centimeter accuracy of mapping and positioning. The presented system not only gives satisfying localization precision, but also has the potential to expand other sensors (such as visual odometry, ultra wideband (UWB) beacon and lidar) to further improve the localization performance.

Sharing a common map for online localization provides a fleet of autonomous vehicles with the possibility to maintain and access a consistent map source, and therefore reduce redundancy while increasing efficiency. However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.","19","minimisation - navigation - road vehicles - statistics - traffic control","appearance-dependent selection method - landmark coobservability statistics - ranking function - adaptive landmark selection - unsupervised method - visual cue extraction - data usage reduction - exchanged data minimization - mobile network connectivity - redundancy reduction - autonomous vehicles - online localization map - bandwidth-constrained environments - distributed long-term visual localization systems - appearance-based landmark selection","C3360B Road-traffic system control - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C1180 Optimisation techniques","B60W - G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G08G1/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The size of the pose graph has a substantial influence on the runtime and the memory requirements of a SLAM system, which hinders long-term mapping. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient information-theoretic compression of pose graphs. Our approach estimates the expected information gain of laser measurements with respect to the resulting occupancy grid map. It allows for restricting the size of the pose graph depending on the information that the robot acquires about the environment or based on a given memory limit, which results in an any-space SLAM system. When discarding laser scans, our approach marginalizes out the corresponding pose nodes from the graph. To avoid a densely connected pose graph, which would result from exact marginalization, we propose an approximation to marginalization that is based on local Chow-Liu trees and maintains a sparse graph. Real world experiments suggest that our approach effectively reduces the growth of the pose graph while minimizing the loss of information in the resulting grid map.","15","data acquisition - graph theory - laser ranging - SLAM (robots) - trees (mathematics)","information-theoretic graph pruning - graph-based SLAM - laser range finders - pose graph - data acquisition - Chow-Liu trees - sparse graph","C3390 Robotics - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01C3/00 - G01S17/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Although most of the state-of-the-art that approaches for place recognition are vision-based, visual sensors lack adaptability in environments with poor or dynamically changing illumination. In this paper, a 3-D-laser-based place recognition algorithm is proposed to accomplish loop closure detection for simultaneous localization and mapping. An image model named bearing angle (BA) is adopted to convert 3-D laser points to 2-D images, and then ORB features extracted from BA images are utilized to perform scene matching. Since the computational cost for matching a query BA image with all the BA images in a database is too high to meet the requirement of performing real-time place recognition, a visual bag of words approach is used to improve search efficiency. Furthermore, a speed normalization algorithm and a 3-D geometry-based verification algorithm are proposed to complete the proposed place recognition algorithm.

Localization, mapping, scene perception, vehicle control, trajectory optimization, and higher-level planning decisions associated with autonomous vehicle development remain full of open challenges. This is especially true for unconstrained, real-world operation where the margin of allowable error is extremely small and the number of edge-cases is extremely large. Until these problems are solved, human beings will remain an integral part of the driving task, monitoring the AI system as it performs anywhere from just over 0% to just under 100% of the driving. The governing objectives of the MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology (MIT-AVT) study are to 1) undertake large-scale real-world driving data collection that includes high-definition video to fuel the development of deep learning-based internal and external perception systems; 2) gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with vehicle automation technology by integrating video data with vehicle state data, driver characteristics, mental models, and self-reported experiences with technology; and 3) identify how technology and other factors related to automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives. In pursuing these objectives, we have instrumented 23 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, 2 Volvo S90 vehicles, 2 Range Rover Evoque, and 2 Cadillac CT6 vehicles for both long-term (over a year per driver) and medium-term (one month per driver) naturalistic driving data collection. Furthermore, we are continually developing new methods for the analysis of the massive-scale dataset collected from the instrumented vehicle fleet. The recorded data streams include IMU, GPS, and CAN messages, and high-definition video streams of the driver's face, the driver cabin, the forward roadway, and the instrument cluster (on select vehicles).

As the robot moves from its starting position and the estimated map grows, the computational and memory footprint of a dense 3D map increases and might exceed the robot capabilities in a short time. However, a global map is still needed to maintain its consistency and plan for distant goals, possibly out of the robot field of view. In this work, we address such problem by proposing a real-time stereo mapping pipeline, feasible for standard CPUs, which is locally dense and globally sparse and accurate. Our algorithm is based on a graph relating poses and salient visual points, in order to maintain a long-term accuracy with a small cost.

In this paper, we present an approach to localize a mobile robot with a low frequency camera with respect to an image sequence, recorded previously within a different season. Our approach uses a discrete Bayes filter and a sensor model based on whole image descriptors. Thereby it exploits sequential information to model the dynamics of the system. Since we compute a probability distribution over the whole state space, our approach can handle more complex trajectories that may include same season loop-closures as well as fragmented sub-sequences.

ToF (time-of-flight) cameras are a relatively new kind of sensors in robotics. They enable the real-time capture of the distance and the grayscale information of a scene. Due to the increase of the image resolution of ToF cameras, now highlevel computer vision algorithms for visual feature extraction (e.g. SIFT or SURF) can be applied to the captured images. These visual features combined with the corresponding distance information give a full measurement of 3D landmarks. An obvious problem to be solved is the continuously growing number of landmarks. So far, all ever seen landmarks are just accumulated irrespective of their utility and the then required resources. Rather, one should keep only really useful landmarks, e.g. such that localization quality in the whole operational area is kept above a given threshold. In fact a lifelong running SLAM approach is dependent on means to select and discard landmarks. That is even more acute in case of feature-rich sensor data as provided with high update rates by sensors like a ToF camera. We run our SLAM approach in a real-world experiment within an indoor environment. The experiment was performed on a P3DX-platform equipped with a PMD CamCube 2.0 and a Xsens IMU.","22","cameras - feature extraction - image resolution - robot vision - service robots - SLAM (robots)","DoF SLAM - ToF camera - localization and mapping - service robotics - time-of-flight - sensors - image resolution - computer vision - feature extraction - 3D landmark","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Phenomena of interest include flows or variations in volatiles, gas composition or concentration, particulate density, or even simply temperature. Improved measurement of these processes enables understanding of exotic geologies and distributions or correlating indicators of trapped water or biological activity. However, such data is often needed in unsafe areas such as caves, lava tubes, or steep ravines not easily reached by current spacecraft and planetary robots. To address this capability gap, we have developed miniaturized, expendable sensors which can be ballistically lobbed from a robotic rover or static lander - or even dropped during a flyover. These projectiles can perform sensing during flight and after anchoring to terrain features. By augmenting exploration systems with these sensors, we can extend situational awareness, perform long-duration monitoring, and reduce utilization of primary mobility resources, all of which are crucial in surface missions. We call the integrated payload that includes a cold gas launcher, smart projectiles, planning software, network discovery, and science sensing: PHALANX. In this paper, we introduce the mission architecture for PHALANX and describe an exploration concept that pairs projectile sensors with a rover ldquomothership.rdquo Science use cases explored include reconnaissance using ballistic cameras, volatiles detection, and building timelapse maps of temperature and illumination conditions. Strategies to autonomously coordinate constellations of deployed sensors to self-discover and localize with peer ranging (i.e. a ldquolocal GPSrdquo) are summarized, thus providing communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) of the rover. Capabilities were demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing with a terrestrial prototype. The approach to developing a terrestrial prototype is discussed, including design of the launching mechanism, projectile optimization, micro-electronics fabrication, and sensor selection. Results from early testing and characterization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are reported. Nodes were subjected to successful burn-in tests over 48 hours at full logging duty cycle. Integrated field tests were conducted in the Roverscape, a half-acre planetary analog environment at NASA Ames, where we tested up to 10 sensor nodes simultaneously coordinating with an exploration rover. Ranging accuracy has been demonstrated to be within +/-10cm over 20m using commodity radios when compared to high-resolution laser scanner ground truthing. Evolution of the design, including progressive miniaturization of the electronics and iterated modifications of the enclosure housing for streamlining and optimized radio performance are described. Finally, lessons learned to date, gaps toward eventual flight mission implementation, and continuing future development plans are discussed.","24","aerospace robotics - Global Positioning System - mobile robots - planetary rovers - space research - space vehicles - wireless sensor networks","expendable sensors - robotic rover - static lander - commercial-off-the-shelf components - burn-in tests - integrated field tests - half-acre planetary analog environment - sensor nodes - exploration rover - ranging accuracy - streamlining radio performance - optimized radio performance - eventual flight mission implementation - future development plans - Expendable projectile sensor networks - planetary exploration - hard-to-reach areas - planetary science inquiry - particulate density - improved measurement - exotic geologies - correlating indicators - trapped water - unsafe areas - lava tubes - steep ravines - current spacecraft - planetary robots - capability gap - sensor selection - projectile optimization - terrestrial prototype - physical testing - communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight - peer ranging - deployed sensors - volatiles detection - ballistic cameras - rover mothership - exploration concept - mission architecture - PHALANX - science sensing - network discovery - planning software - smart projectiles - cold gas launcher - integrated payload - surface missions - primary mobility resources - long-duration monitoring - situational awareness - augmenting exploration systems - time 48.0 hour","C3390C Mobile robots - C3240 Transducers and sensing devices - C3360L Aerospace control","B64G1/00 - G05D1/00 - H04W84/18 - G01S19/01 - B64G1/16","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Each robot estimates its pose and reconstructs the environment simultaneously using the same monocular simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm. Meanwhile, they share the results of their incremental maps by streaming keyframes through the robot operating system messages and the wireless network. Subsequently, each robot in the group can obtain the global map with high efficiency. To build the collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping architecture, two novel approaches are proposed. One is a robust relocalization method based on active loop closure, and the other is a vision-based multi-robot relative pose estimating and map merging method. The former is used to solve the problem of tracking failures when robots carry out long-term monocular simultaneous localization and mapping in large-scale environments, while the latter uses the appearance-based place recognition method to determine multi-robot relative poses and build the large-scale global map by merging each robot's local map. Both KITTI data set and our own data set acquired by a handheld camera are used to evaluate the proposed system.

VO has reached a maturity that has allowed us to successfully use it for certain classes of applications: space, ground, aerial, and underwater. In the presence of loop closures, VO can be used as a building block for a complete SLAM algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for VO to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, VO has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. VO offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.","91","cameras - distance measurement - motion estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","visual odometry - VO pipeline - robust estimation - error propagation - space application - ground application - aerial application - underwater application - loop closures - SLAM algorithm - motion drift - driving autonomous car - radar sensor - Lidar-based system - egomotion estimation - easier-to-manufacture solution - digital camera - robotic system","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01B - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G06T - G06T7/20","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2012, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Expecting to indicate some insights into visual localization, we specifically performed two explorations on active localization and more importantly explored to upgrade them from active to passive localization with extra geometry information available. In order to produce unconstrained and accurate 2D location estimation of interested object, we constructed an active localization system by fusing detection, tracking and recognition. Based on recognition, we proposed a collaborative strategy making mutual enhancement between detection and tracking possible to obtain better performance on 2D location estimation. Meanwhile, to actively estimate semantic location of interested visual region, we employed latest state-of-the-art light weight CNN models specifically designed for efficiency and trained two of them with large place dataset in perspective of scene recognition. What's more, using depth information available from RGB-D camera, we improved the active system for 2D location of interested object to a passive system for relative 3D location of device to the interested object. Firstly estimated was the 3D location of the interested object in the coordinate system of device, then relative location of device to the interested object in world coordinate system was deduced with appropriate assumption. Evaluations both subjectively on a RGB-D sequence obtained in a lab environment and practically on a robotic platform in an office environment indicated that the improved system was suitable for autonomous following robot. As well, the active system for rough semantic location estimation of interested visual region was promoted to a passive system for fine location estimation of device, with available 3D map describing the visited environment. In perspective of place recognition, we first adopted one of the efficient CNN models previously trained for semantic location estimation as a base to generate CNN features for both retrieval of candidate loops in the map and geometrical consistency checking of retrieved loops, then true loops were used to deduce fine location of device itself in environment. Comparison with state-of-the-art results reflected that the promoted system was adequate for long-term robotic autonomy. Achieving favorable performances, the presented four explorations have implied adequacy for elaborating on some insights into visual localization.","120","convolutional neural nets - image colour analysis - mobile robots - object detection - object tracking - robot vision","visual region - light weight CNN models - place recognition - rough semantic location estimation - relative location - coordinate system - passive system - active system - active localization system - passive localization aids device - active localization assists device - passive two ways - active ways - visual localization - explorations","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots - C5290 Neural computing techniques","G05D1/00 - G06T - G06N3/02","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Knowledge about the own pose and representations of the environment are needed for a series of high level applications. Service robots should be designed for life-long and robust operation in dynamic environments. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, an approach to address the ever growing number of landmarks in life-long operation is presented. Typically, SLAM approaches just accumulate features over time and do not discard them anymore. Therefore, the required resources in terms of memory and processing power are growing over time. In our approach, the absolute number of landmarks can be restricted by an upper bound since we introduce a method to specifically select and replace landmarks once the upper bound has been reached. The second contribution is related to improving the robustness of the landmark assignment problem in case of image based features as needed with natural landmarks. The approach has been successfully evaluated in a real world experiment on a Pioneer-3DX platform within a complex unmodified indoor environment.","10","mobile robots - robot vision - robust control - service robots - SLAM (robots)","robust visual SLAM approach - life-long operation - service robotics - dynamic environment - landmark assignment problem - robustness - image-based feature - Pioneer-3DX platform - complex unmodified indoor environment","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1320 Stability in control theory","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2009, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

For example, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) need to be capable of operating safely in adverse and low-visibility conditions, such as at night or in the presence of smoke. The key to a resilient UGV perception system lies in the use of multiple sensor modalities, e.g., operating at different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum, to compensate for the limitations of a single sensor type. In this paper, visual and infrared imaging are combined in a Visual-SLAM algorithm to achieve localization. We propose to evaluate the quality of data provided by each sensor modality prior to data combination. This evaluation is used to discard low-quality data, i.e., data most likely to induce large localization errors. In this way, perceptual failures are anticipated and mitigated. An extensive experimental evaluation is conducted on data sets collected with a UGV in a range of environments and adverse conditions, including the presence of smoke (obstructing the visual camera), fire, extreme heat (saturating the infrared camera), low-light conditions (dusk), and at night with sudden variations of artificial light. A total of 240 trajectory estimates are obtained using five different variations of data sources and data combination strategies in the localization method. In particular, the proposed approach for selective data combination is compared to methods using a single sensor type or combining both modalities without preselection. We show that the proposed framework allows for camera-based localization resilient to a large range of low-visibility conditions.","75","infrared imaging - remotely operated vehicles - robot vision - visual perception","camera based localization - selective data combination - artificial light - low light conditions - extreme heat - sensor modality - visual-SLAM algorithm - infrared imaging - resilient UGV perception system - unmanned ground vehicles - robotics - resilient localization - thermal imaging - visual imaging","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G06T","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2014, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Under the assumption that significant parts of the scene do not alter their geometry and serve as natural landmarks, the accuracy of our visual approach outperforms consumer grade GPS systems. In an experimental setup we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm and evaluate the performance by geometric validation from an observer's view.

Previous audio ray tracing approaches rely on all observed rays and grids. As such observation errors caused by sound reflection, sound occlusion, wall occlusion, sounds at misdetected grids, etc. can significantly degrade the ability to locate sound sources in a map. A three-layered selective audio ray tracing mechanism is proposed in this work. The first layer conducts frame-based unreliable ray rejection (sensory rejection) considering sound reflection and wall occlusion. The second layer introduces triangulation and audio tracing to detect falsely detected sound sources, rejecting audio rays associated to these misdetected sounds sources (short-term rejection).

Since dead-reckoned navigation is accurate in short time windows, the vehicle accumulates several water column depth point clouds- or submaps-during the course of its survey. We propose an xy-alignment procedure between these submaps in order to enforce consistent bathymetric structure over time, and therefore attempt to bound long-term navigation drift.

Key to a successful visual SLAM system is correctly recognizing the objects and labeling where the robot is. Local image features are popular with constructing object recognition system, which are invariant to image scaling, translation, rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine. In this paper, we proposed an object recognition method based on the bag of word model, mainly idea includes three steps as follows: firstly, a set of local image patches are sampled using a key point detector, and each patch is a descriptor based on scale invariant feature transform. Then outliers are removed by RANSAC algorithm, and the resulting distribution of descriptors is quantified by using vector quantization against a pre-specified codebook to convert it to a histogram of votes for codebook centers. Finally, a KNN algorithm is used to classify images through the resulting global descriptor vector. The experimental results show that our proposed method has a better performance against the previous methods.","31","image classification - image coding - mobile robots - object recognition - path planning - random processes - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - vector quantisation","object recognition - bag of word model - mobile robot navigation - long term positioning - autonomous mobile robot - visual SLAM system - local image feature - image scaling - image translation - image rotation - local image patch - key point detector - scale invariant feature transform - RANSAC algorithm - vector quantization - codebook center - KNN algorithm is - image classification","B6135E Image recognition - B6135C Image and video coding - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C1140Z Other topics in statistics","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - G06T9/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for route-following applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day. Both exhibit significant appearance change due to lighting variation. Through these experiments we show that safe localization can be achieved by bridging the appearance gap.","21","image sensors - mobile robots - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","environmental appearance - multiexperience localization - MEL algorithm - visual teach and repeat - VT&R - vision-based algorithm - route-following algorithm - autonomous robot - vision sensor","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C3120C Spatial variables control - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - H01L27/146 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Robotic imaging can be used to obtain bridge surface image sets for automated on-site analysis. We present a novel automated crack detection algorithm, the STRUM (spatially tuned robust multifeature) classifier, and demonstrate results on real bridge data using a state-of-the-art robotic bridge scanning system. By using machine learning classification, we eliminate the need for manually tuning threshold parameters. The algorithm uses robust curve fitting to spatially localize potential crack regions even in the presence of noise. Multiple visual features that are spatially tuned to these regions are computed. Feature computation includes examining the scale-space of the local feature in order to represent the information and the unknown salient scale of the crack. The classification results are obtained with real bridge data from hundreds of crack regions over two bridges. This comprehensive analysis shows a peak STRUM classifier performance of 95% compared with 69% accuracy from a more typical image-based approach. In order to create a composite global view of a large bridge span, an image sequence from the robot is aligned computationally to create a continuous mosaic. A crack density map for the bridge mosaic provides a computational description as well as a global view of the spatial patterns of bridge deck cracking.

This definition is valid in loop-rich trajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise maps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging autonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less trajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our study is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in either the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the merged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with discriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which efficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and (2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in shape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a preemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching hypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel collection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The results obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves on previous map-matching approaches.","13","convolution - image matching - image retrieval - mobile robots - neural nets - path planning - robot vision","deformable map matching - uncertain loop-less maps - robotic mapping - robotic localization - 2D moving plane - mobile robots - loop-rich trajectories - mapper robot - autonomous navigation and driving systems - loop-less trajectories - image retrieval - discriminative deep convolutional neural network features - DCNN features - map merge - shape difference minimization - uncertain loopless maps - North Campus Long-Term dataset - NCLT dataset - GPS data - map collections","B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5290 Neural computing techniques - C6160S Spatial and pictorial databases - C7250R Information retrieval techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06F17/30 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

GPS/INS (inertial navigation system) solutions, which are insufficient alone to maintain a vehicle within a lane, can fail because of significant radio frequency noise or jamming, tall buildings, trees, and other blockage or multipath scenarios. LIDAR and camera map-based vehicle localization can fail when optical features become obscured, such as with snow or dust, or with changes to gravel or dirt road surfaces. Localizing ground penetrating radar (LGPR) is a new mode of a priori map-based vehicle localization designed to complement existing approaches with a low sensitivity to failure modes of LIDAR, camera, and GPS/INS sensors due to its low-frequency RF energy, which couples deep into the ground. Most subsurface features detected are inherently stable over time. Significant research, discussed herein, remains to prove general utility. We have developed a novel low-profile ultra-low power LGPR system and demonstrated real-time operation underneath a passenger vehicle. A correlation maximizing optimization technique was developed to allow real-time localization at 126 Hz. Here we present the detailed design and results from highway testing, which uses a simple heuristic for fusing LGPR estimates with a GPS/INS system. Cross-track localization accuracies of 4.3 cm RMS relative to a “truth” RTK GPS/INS unit at speeds up to 100 km/h (60 mph) are demonstrated. These results, if generalizable, introduce a widely scalable real-time localization method with cross-track accuracy as good as or better than current localization methods.","30","Global Positioning System - ground penetrating radar - inertial navigation - position control - remotely operated vehicles - road vehicles","low-profile ultra-low power LGPR system - camera map-based vehicle localization - light detection and ranging - LIDAR - inertial navigation system - Global Positioning System - INS solution - GPS solution - road networks - autonomous ground vehicle localization - ground penetrating radar localization - frequency 126 Hz","C3360B Road-traffic system control - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3390T Telerobotics","B60W - G01P7/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G08G1/00 - G01C21/16 - G01S13/89 - G01T1/10","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Such sampling requires persistent autonomous underwater vehicles, that have a similarly long deployment duration. Actively actuated (propeller-driven) underwater vehicles have proven effective in multiple sampling scenarios, however they have limited deployment endurance. The emergence of less actuated vehicles, i.e., underwater gliders, has enabled greater energy savings and thus increased endurance. Due to reduced actuation, these vehicles are more susceptible to external forces, e.g., ocean currents, causing them to have poor navigational and localization accuracy underwater. This is exacerbated in coastal regions, where current velocities are the same order of magnitude as the vehicle velocity. In this paper, we examine a method of reducing navigation and localization error, not only for navigation, but more so for more accurately reconstructing the path that the glider traversed to contextualize the gathered data, with respect to the science question at hand. We present a set of algorithms for offline processing that accurately localizes the traversed path of an underwater glider over long-term, ocean deployments. The proposed method utilizes terrain-based navigation with only depth, altimeter and compass data compared to local bathymetry maps to provide accurate reconstructions of traversed paths in the ocean.","33","autonomous underwater vehicles - mobile robots - path planning - telerobotics","underwater gliders autonomy - terrain-based navigation","C3360J Marine system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Random sample consensus (RANSAC) paradigm is used to group the line segments. During the navigation, onboard odometry is used at the beginning stage to estimate the information of environment for visual reckoning, while lamps on the ceiling act as beacons for positioning to eliminate accumulation of errors after a long-term run.

In these applications, long-term operation requires the vehicle to build up a spatial map of the environment while simultaneously localising itself within the map, a task known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). In the first part of this paper we present an architecture for performing inertial-sensor based SLAM on an aerial vehicle. We demonstrate an on-line path planning scheme that intelligently plans the vehicle's trajectory while exploring unknown terrain in order to maximise the quality of both the resulting SLAM map and localisation estimates necessary for the autonomous control of the UAV. Two important performance properties and their relationship to the dynamic motion and path planning systems on-board the UAV are analysed. Firstly we analyse information-based measures such as entropy. Secondly we perform an observability analysis of inertial SLAM by recasting the algorithms into an indirect error model form. Qualitative knowledge gained from the observability analysis is used to assist in the design of an information-based trajectory planner for the UAV. Results of the online path planning algorithm are presented using a high-fidelity 6-DoF simulation of a UAV during a simulated navigation and mapping task.","13","aircraft instrumentation - aircraft navigation - Global Positioning System - path planning - remotely operated vehicles - sensors - terrain mapping","active airborne localisation - active airborne exploration - unmanned aerial vehicle applications - navigation infrastructure - spatial map - Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping - inertial sensor - on-line path planning scheme - vehicle trajectory - autonomous control - dynamic motion - path planning systems - entropy - observability analysis - indirect error model form - information-based trajectory planner - online path planning algorithm - high-fidelity 6-DoF simulation - mapping task","B7630 Aerospace instrumentation and equipment - B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B7230 Sensing devices and transducers - C7460 Aerospace engineering computing - C3360L Aerospace control","G01S - G05D1/00 - B60W30/095 - G01T1/10","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2006, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In terms of place recognition, this implies that the number of images being considered may increase until exceeding the computational resources of the robot. In this paper we consider a scenario where, given multiple independent large maps, possibly from different cities or locations, a robot must effectively and in real time decide whether it can localize itself in one of those known maps. Since the number of images to be handled by such a system is likely to be extremely large, we find that it is beneficial to decompose the set of images into independent groups or environments. This raises a new question: Given a query image, how do we select the best environment? This paper proposes a similarity criterion that can be used to solve this problem. It is based on the observation that, if each environment is described in terms of its co-occurrent features, similarity between environments can be established by comparing their co-occurrence matrices. We show that this leads to a novel place recognition algorithm that divides the collection of images into environments and arranges them in a hierarchy of inverted indices. By selecting first the relevant environment for the operating robot, we can reduce the number of images to perform the actual loop detection, reducing the execution time while preserving the accuracy. The practicality of this approach is shown through experimental results on several large datasets covering a combined distance of more than 750Km.","25","cartography - image recognition - matrix algebra - robot vision","environment selection - hierarchical place recognition algorithm - multiple independent large maps - image decomposition - query image - similarity criterion - co-occurrent features - co-occurrence matrices - image collection - inverted indices hierarchy - loop detection","B6135E Image recognition - B0210 Algebra - C3390 Robotics - C1110 Algebra - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

One of the main aims of this work is to provide a probabilistically grounded interpretation of such a partitioning technique in the context of generating local maps. We also discuss how to apply it to different kinds of sensory data (landmarks extracted from stereo images and laser range scans) and how to consider them simultaneously. An important feature of our approach is that the partitioning takes into account the intrinsic characteristics of the sensors, such as the sensor field of view, instead of applying heuristics supplied by a human as in other works. Thus the robot builds “subjective” local maps whose size will be determined by the nature of the sensors. The ideas presented here are supported by experimental results from a real mobile robot as well as simulations for statistical analysis.

In this paper, we propose a novel AUV localization method taking advantage of the recent progress in ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). During navigation, the AUV performs intermittent local background flow velocity measurements or estimates using on-board sensors. A series of preloaded flow velocity forecast maps generated by OGCMs are referred by a particle filter in updating particle weights based on resemblance between forecasts and local estimation. A rigorous derivation of the problem in probability theory is presented to reveal the recursive structure of the target distribution function. Simulations in a simple double-gyre velocity field exhibit satisfactory converging localization error. Further simulations in a flow field with local flow fluctuations that are not resolved by OGCMs show similar convergent localization error with a slower converging rate. As a first step towards a new set of underwater localization methods, this work presents promising results and reveals the possibility of realizing converging global underwater localization through partial utilization of the background flow information that is easily accessible.","38","autonomous underwater vehicles - mobile robots - particle filtering (numerical methods) - telerobotics - velocity measurement","autonomous underwater vehicles - AUV localization method - ocean general circulation models - intermittent local background flow velocity measurements - on-board sensors - preloaded flow velocity forecast maps - particle filter - local estimation - probability theory - target distribution function recursive structure - double-gyre velocity field - converging localization error - underwater localization methods","C3360J Marine system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics - C1140G Monte Carlo methods - C1260S Signal processing theory","G05D1/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

These methods assume Markov independence of observations, implying that observations made by a robot correspond to a static map. However, in real human environments, observations include occlusions due to unmapped objects like chairs and tables, and dynamic objects like humans. We introduce an episodic non-Markov localization algorithm that maintains estimates of the belief over the trajectory of the robot while explicitly reasoning about observations and their correlations arising from unmapped static objects, moving objects, as well as objects from the static map. Observations are classified as arising from long-term features, short-term features, or dynamic features, which correspond to mapped objects, unmapped static objects, and unmapped dynamic objects respectively. By detecting time steps along the robot's trajectory where unmapped observations prior to such time steps are unrelated to those afterwards, non-Markov localization limits the history of observations and pose estimates to “episodes” over which the belief is computed. We demonstrate non-Markov localization in challenging real world indoor and outdoor environments over multiple datasets, comparing it with alternative state-of-the-art approaches, showing it to be robust as well as accurate.","15","inference mechanisms - Markov processes - mobile robots - trajectory control","episodic nonMarkov localization - short-term features - long-term features - mobile robots - Markov observation independence - static map - robot trajectory - unmapped static objects - static map - mapped objects","C3390C Mobile robots - C3120C Spatial variables control - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C1140J Markov processes","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06F15/18 - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2014, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Approach: This study introduced a monocular SLAM method, which uses the Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) representation for the scene. The scene represented as clouds of sift features within the map; this hierarchical representation of space, serving to estimate the current direction in the environment within the current session. The system exploited the tracking of the same features of successive frames to calculate scalar weights for these features, to build a map of the environment indicating the camera movement, then by comparing the camera movement of the current moving with the true pathway within the same session the system can help and advice the blind person to navigate more confidently, through auditory information for the path way in the surroundings. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) used to estimate the camera movement within the successive frames. Results: The experimental work tested using the proposed method with a hand-held camera walking in indoor environment. The results show a good estimation on the spatial locations of the camera within few milliseconds. Tracking of the true pathway in addition to semantic environment within the session can give a good support to the blind person for navigation.

A key motivation is the recognition that a single image may be a poor exemplar of what constitutes a place. Images are not `places' nor are they `documents'. Instead, by treating image-sequences as a multimodal distribution over topics - and by discovering topics incrementally and online - it is possible to both reduce the memory footprint of place recognition systems, and to improve precision and recall. Distinctive key-places are represented by a cluster topics found from the covisibility graph of a relative simultaneous localization and mapping engine - key-places inherently span many images. A dynamic vocabulary of visual words and density based clustering is used to continually estimate a set of visual topics, changes in which drive the place-recognition process. The system is evaluated using an indoor robot sequence, a standard outdoor robot sequence and a long-term sequence from a static camera. Experiments demonstrate qualitatively distinct themes associated with discovered places - from common place types such as `hallway', or `desk-area', to temporal concepts such as `dusk', `dawn' or `mid-day'. Compared to traditional image-based place-recognition, this reduces the information that must be stored without reducing place-recognition performance.","16","graph theory - image sensors - image sequences - object recognition - pattern clustering - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","incremental unsupervised topological place discovery - online place discovery-and-recognition engine - memory footprint reduction - place recognition systems - precision improvement - recall improvement - cluster topics - covisibility graph - relative simultaneous localization-and-mapping engine - dynamic visual words vocabulary - density based clustering - visual topics estimation - indoor robot sequence - standard outdoor robot sequence - static camera","B6135E Image recognition - B7230G Image sensors - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics","G06T - H01L27/146 - H04N5/30","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2014, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Concurrent mapping and localisation or simultaneous localisation and mapping is a stochastic map building method which permits consistent robot navigation without requiring an a priori map. The governing idea which guides autonomous robotics consists in saying that the vehicle builds its chart progressively during exploration enabling it to evolve in the long term in unknown places in advance. When the robot environment chart is not known a priori, a generation module of incremental chart must obligatorily be integrated into the navigation system. The map is built incrementally as the robot observes the environment with its on-board sensors and, at the same time, is used to localise the robot. Unfortunately, the inaccuracy of the odometric sensors does not allow a sufficiently correct positioning of the robot. In this paper, simultaneous localisation and map building is performed with a metric approach which permits both precision and robustness. The most important innovation of the approach is the way how errors in the robot localisation control are handled by map building using the landmarks localisation information. The method uses data from a laser scanner to extract distances and orientations of landmarks and combines control localisation and metric paradigm. The metric approach, based on the Kalman filter, uses a new concept to avoid the problem of the drift in odometry. The simulation section will validate the maps representation approach and presents different aspect of environments.","14","distance measurement - Kalman filters - mobile robots - navigation - object detection - position control - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - stochastic processes","metric approach - environment mapping - mobile robotics - autonomous navigation - unknown environment - concurrent mapping and localisation - simultaneous localisation and mapping - stochastic map building method - robot navigation - autonomous robotics - vehicle - exploration - robot environment chart - incremental chart - navigation system - robot on-board sensors - odometric sensors - robot positioning - robustness - robot localisation control - landmark localisation information - laser scanner data - landmark distance extraction - landmark orientation extraction - control localisation - Kalman filter - odometry drift","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C3390C Mobile robots - C3120C Spatial variables control - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01B - G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2014, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, developing a mapping and a localization method using these kinds of models is very challenging, especially if robots must deal with long-term mapping, localization, navigation, occlusions, and dynamic environments. In other words, the mobile robot has to deal with environmental appearance change, which modifies its representation of the environment. This paper proposes an indoor appearance-based mapping and a localization method for mobile robots based on the human memory model, which was used to build a Feature Stability Histogram (FSH) at each node in the robot topological map. This FSH registers local feature stability over time through a voting scheme, and the most stable features were considered for mapping, for Bayesian localization and for incrementally updating the current appearance reference view in the topological map. The experimental results are presented using an omnidirectional images dataset acquired over the long-term and considering: illumination changes (time of day, different seasons), occlusions, random removal of features, and perceptual aliasing. The results include a comparison with the approach proposed by Dayoub and Duckett (2008) [19] and the popular Bag-of-Words (Bazeille and Filliat, 2010) [35] approach.

We propose a system for detecting and modeling ascending stairways while performing simultaneous localization and mapping, such that the traversability of each stairway can be assessed by estimating its physical properties. The long-term objective of our approach is to enable exploration of multiple floors of a building by allowing stairways to be considered during path planning as traversable portals to new frontiers. We design a generative model of a stairway as a single object. We localize these models with respect to the map, and estimate the dimensions of the stairway as a whole, as well as its steps. With these estimates, a robot can determine if the stairway is traversable based on its climbing capabilities. Our system consists of two parts: a computationally efficient detector that leverages geometric cues from dense depth imagery to detect sets of ascending stairs, and a stairway modeler that uses multiple detections to infer the location and parameters of a stairway that is discovered during exploration. We demonstrate the performance of this system when deployed on several mobile platforms using a Microsoft Kinect sensor.","21","image sensors - mobile robots - object detection - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","ascending stairway modeling - dense depth imagery - traversability analysis - stairway localization - multifloor exploration - stairway detection - stairway traversal - simultaneous localization and mapping - path planning - stairway generative model - robot climbing capability - computationally efficient detector - geometric cues - stairway modeler - Microsoft Kinect sensor - mobile platforms","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3240K Image sensors - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - H01L27/146 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Experimental (EXP)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2013, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, odometry produces cumulative error because of uneven terrains or wheel slippage and this error increases proportionally with the distance traveled by the mobile robot. Therefore, it is necessary to augment odometry with other sensors to improve its accuracy. This paper proposes an estimation method of mobile robot orientation using an environmental magnetic field (magnetic field that occurs in the environment). A three-axis magnetic sensor is utilized to scan the environmental magnetic field to build a magnetic database on a grid map called 'a magnetic map' with the mobile robot operated with a joystick on a desired route. The mobile robot then estimates its orientation by comparing the magnetic sensor readings with the magnetic data stored in the magnetic map. However, even if the proposed method can improve the accuracy of the odometry, positioning error still remains as a major problem in long term navigation. In this work, a localization method using Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) based on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is utilized to fix the positioning error at the areas where landmark can be observed. The experimental results showed that the mobile robot could localize robustly in any environments with the proposed method.","16","distance measurement - magnetic sensors - mobile robots - Monte Carlo methods - optical radar","positioning error - Monte Carlo localization - magnetic map - grid map - magnetic database - three-axis magnetic sensor - environmental magnetic field - mobile robot orientation estimation method - short term navigation - odometry - light detection and ranging - LIDAR - mobile robot localization method","B6320C Optical radar - B7230 Sensing devices and transducers - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - B7310L Magnetic variables measurement - B0240G Monte Carlo methods - C3390C Mobile robots - C3240 Transducers and sensing devices - C1140G Monte Carlo methods","G01B - G01R33/00 - G01S17/00 - G05D1/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2014, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In the contexts of robot navigation and mapping, place recognition amounts to globally localizing a robot or map segment without being given any prior estimate. An efficient method of solving this problem involves first selecting a set of keypoints in the scene which store an encoding of their local region, and then utilizing a sublinear-time search into a database of keypoints previously generated from the global map to identify places with common features. We present an algorithm to embed arbitrary keypoint descriptors in a reduced-dimension metric space, in order to frame the problem as an efficient nearest neighbor search. Given that there are a multitude of possibilities for keypoint design, we propose a general methodology for comparing keypoint location selection heuristics and descriptor models that describe the region around the keypoint. With respect to selecting keypoint locations, we introduce a metric that encodes how likely it is that the keypoint will be found in the presence of noise and occlusions during mapping passes. Metrics for keypoint descriptors are used to assess the distinguishability between the distributions of matches and non-matches and the probability the correct match will be found in an approximate k-nearest neighbors search. Verification of the test outcomes is done by comparing the various keypoint designs on a kilometers-scale place recognition problem. We apply our design evaluation methodology to three keypoint selection heuristics and six keypoint descriptor models. A full place recognition system is presented, including a series of match verification algorithms which effectively filter out false positives. Results from city-scale and long-term mapping problems illustrate our approach for both offline and online SLAM, map merging, and global localization and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to produce accurate maps over trajectories of hundreds of kilometers.

The CoBots include several levels of autonomy, and in this paper we focus on their localization and navigation algorithms. We present the Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR) algorithm, which refines the proposal distribution of the particle filter used for localization with sensor observations using analytically computed state space derivatives on a vector map. We also present the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering algorithm that extracts planar regions from depth images in real time. These planar regions are then projected onto the 2D vector map of the building, and along with the laser rangefinder observations, used with CGR for localization. For navigation, we present a hierarchical planner, which computes a topological policy using a graph representation of the environment, computes motion commands based on the topological policy, and then modifies the motion commands to side-step perceived obstacles. We started logging the deployments of the CoBots one and a halfyears ago, and have since collected logs of the CoBots traversing more than 130 km over 1082 deployments and a total run time of 182 h, which we publish as a dataset consisting of more than 10 million laser scans.

Localisation methods that rely upon such modeling often fail, as model boundaries succumb to unpredictable events. This paper presents the development of a self-contained localisation system that purposely obviates the need for odometric information, and an associated kinematic model, to provide robot anonymity. Without odometry, the system is oblivious to the non-systematic vagaries of the robotic platform interacting with a natural domain. The proposed system hypothesises about the robot's absolute pose by algorithmically solving the kidnapped robot problem using exteroceptive based perception. Since no a priori information is assumed, long-term pose fixes are derived within a simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) framework. Preliminary results were gathered using a skid steering mobile robot, equipped with a scanning laser rangefinder, in an outdoor environment.

Frequently, solutions to this localization problem rely on GPS information or use expensive three dimensional (3D) sensors. In this paper, we describe a method for long-term vehicle localization based on visual features alone. Our approach utilizes a combination of topological and metric mapping, which we call topometric localization, to encode the coarse topology of the route as well as detailed metric information required for accurate localization. A topometric map is created by driving the route once and recording a database of visual features. The vehicle then localizes by matching features to this database at runtime. Since individual feature matches are unreliable, we employ a discrete Bayes filter to estimate the most likely vehicle position using evidence from a sequence of images along the route. We illustrate the approach using an 8.8 km route through an urban and suburban environment. The method achieves an average localization error of 2.7 m over this route, with isolated worst case errors on the order of 10 m.","19","automated highways - Bayes methods - feature extraction - filtering theory - geographic information systems - image matching - image motion analysis - image sequences - remotely operated vehicles - road vehicles","visual topometric localization - autonomous vehicle - map location - localization problem - long-term vehicle localization - visual feature - topological mapping - metric mapping - route driving - feature matching - discrete Bayes filter - vehicle position estimation - image sequence - suburban environment - localization error","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C7445 Traffic engineering computing - C7840 Geography and cartography computing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1140Z Other topics in statistics","G06T - G06T7/20","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, WITU relies on human intelligence both to maintain long term consistency of its location estimates and to efficiently manage its limited memory and processing capacity. This alludes to a symbiotic relationship between the user and the device and here we look at this symbiotic relationship from an end user perspective. Thus, in order to have a successful interaction, we argue that the user needs to feel comfortable wearing the device while carrying out the intended tasks. We hypothesize that this perceived comfort is dependent on the context in which the device is used.

Using position-invariant robust features (PIRFs), the method can achieve a high rate of recall with 100% precision. It can handle both strong perceptual aliasing and dynamic changes of places efficiently. Its performance also extends beyond conventional images; it is applicable to omnidirectional images for which the major portions of scenes are similar for most places. The proposed PIRF-based Navigation method named PIRF-Nav is evaluated by testing it on two standard datasets in a similar manner as in FAB-MAP and on an additional omnidirectional image dataset that we collected. This extra dataset was collected on 2 days with different specific events, i.e. an open-campus event, to present challenges related to illumination variance and strong dynamic changes, and to test assessment of dynamic scene changes. Results show that PIRF-Nav outperforms FAB-MAP; PIRF-Nav at precision-1 yields a recall rate about twice as high (approximately 80% increase) than that of FAB-MAP. Its computation time is sufficiently short for real-time applications. The method is fully incremental, and requires no offline process for dictionary creation. Additional testing using combined datasets proves that PIRF-Nav can function over the long term and can solve the kidnapped robot problem.","30","feature extraction - mobile robots - path planning - SLAM (robots)","online appearance-based SLAM - incremental appearance-based SLAM - highly dynamic environments - position-invariant robust features - PIRF-based navigation method - FAB-MAP - omnidirectional image dataset - kidnapped robot problem - perceptual aliasing","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2011, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The PIRF is obtained by identifying existing local features (i.e. SIFT) that have a wide baseline visibility within a place (one place contains more than one sequential images). These wide-baseline visible features are then represented as a single PIRF, which is computed as an average of all descriptors associated with the PIRF. Particularly, PIRFs are robust against highly dynamical changes in scene: a single PIRF can be matched correctly against many features from many dynamical images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for scene recognition. Recognition proceeds by matching an individual PIRF to a set of features from test images, with subsequent majority voting to identify a place with the highest matched PIRF. The PIRF system is trained and tested on 2000+ outdoor omnidirectional images and on COLD datasets. Despite its simplicity, PIRF offers a markedly better rate of recognition for dynamic outdoor scenes (ca. 90%) than the use of other features. Additionally, a robot navigation system based on PIRF (PIRF-Nav) can outperform other incremental topological mapping methods in terms of time (70% less) and memory. The number of PIRFs can be reduced further to reduce the time while retaining high accuracy, which makes it suitable for long-term recognition and localization.","40","image recognition","position-invariant robust features - long-term recognition - dynamic outdoor scenes - scale invariant feature transformation - topological mapping","B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2010, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This algorithm will work with a simple map that does not include complete in- formation about the non-static environment. With only an initial incomplete map, a mobile robot cannot estimate its pose because of the inconsistency between the real observations from the environment and the predicted observations on the incomplete map. The proposed localization algorithm uses the approach of sampling from a non-corrupted window, which allows the mobile robot to estimate its pose more robustly in a non-static environment even when subjected to severe corruption of observations. The algorithm sequence involves identifying the corruption by comparing the real observations with the corresponding predicted observations of all particles, sampling particles from a non- corrupted window that consists of multiple non-corrupted sets, and filtering sensor measurements to provide weights to particles in the corrupted sets. After localization, the estimated path may still contain some errors due to long-term corruption. These errors can be corrected using nonlinear constrained least-squares optimization. The incomplete map is then updated using both the corrected path and the stored sensor information. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified via simulations and experiments in various highly non-static environments. Our localization algorithm can increase the success rate of tracking its pose to more than 95% compared to estimates made without its use. After that, the initial incomplete map is updated based on the localization result.","32","filtering theory - image sampling - least squares approximations - mobile robots - Monte Carlo methods - object tracking - pose estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","robust mobile robot localization - nonstatic environments - robust pose tracking method - incomplete map - noncorrupted window - pose estimation - multiple noncorrupted sets - sensor measurement filtering - nonlinear constrained least-squares optimization - Monte Carlo localization","B6135E Image recognition - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0290F Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - B0240G Monte Carlo methods - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C4130 Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - C1140G Monte Carlo methods","G05D1/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2012, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Changing outdoor conditions cause difficulty by drastically altering the information available in the camera images. To confront the problem, we have developed a visual localization system that uses a surveyed three-dimensional (3D)-edge map of permanent structures in the environment. The map has the invariant properties necessary to achieve long-term robust operation. Previous 3D-edge map localization systems usually maintain a single pose hypothesis, making it difficult to initialize without an accurate prior pose estimate and also making them susceptible to misalignment with unmapped edges detected in the camera image. A multihypothesis particle filter is employed here to perform the initialization procedure with significant uncertainty in the vehicle's initial pose. A novel observation function for the particle filter is developed and evaluated against two existing functions. The new function is shown to further improve the abilities of the particle filter to converge given a very coarse estimate of the vehicle's initial pose. An intelligent exposure control algorithm is also developed that improves the quality of the pertinent information in the image. Results gathered over an entire sunny day and also during rainy weather illustrate that the localization system can operate in a wide range of outdoor conditions. The conclusion is that an invariant map, a robust multihypothesis localization algorithm, and an intelligent exposure control algorithm all combine to enable reliable visual localization through challenging outdoor conditions. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","33","artificial intelligence - cameras - mobile robots - particle filtering (numerical methods) - robust control","robust outdoor visual localization - autonomous vehicles - industrial applications - camera images - robust operation - 3D edge map localization systems - single pose hypothesis - multihypothesis particle filter - intelligent exposure control algorithm","C3390C Mobile robots - C4130 Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - C1230 Artificial intelligence - C1320 Stability in control theory - E1550 Control technology and theory - E0210L Numerical analysis","G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2010, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Here, we concentrate on the discovery of new sources of sound through the use of mobility and directed investigation. This is performed in a two-step process. In the first step, a mobile robot first explores the surrounding acoustical environment, creating evidence grid representations to localize the most influential sound sources in the auditory scene. Then in the second step, the robot investigates each potential sound source location in the environment so as to improve the localization result, and identify volume and directionality characteristics of the sound source.

In our case, long term registration means to find the displacement between two images which can have been mapped with many weeks or many months between them. The aim of this study is to help AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) to navigate, in particular to correct the drift of navigation sensors. This type of positioning raises two sorts of problems, which come from image properties: spatial variability and temporal variability. The first one is caused above all by the sonar geometry and appears for example like a modification of the shape or the position of the shadow according to the point of view. This effect can also be seen in textures, for example on megaripples of sand, which can be more or less visible depending on the point of view of the sonar. The second one is more the consequence of the seafloor physics: between two images, mapped at different times, some elements may have changed. An obvious example is the presence of evanescent 'objects' like fishes but this variability can also be seen on sediments, which borders can move due to local bottom dynamics. With the aim to solve these problems and to provide reliable landmarks for matching, we decided to classify and segment the images. The data have first been corrected from TVG (time varying gain) effects and despeckelised in order to process images which are more representative of the seafloor. The basis idea is to use a supervised method of classification. To do that, we consider some parameters which are coming from a decomposition by Gabor filters, in order to segment with linear discriminant analysis and use of the nearest neighbour method. Registration needs accurately localised landmarks: so, this operation is split in several stages, refining step by step the classification, in order to obtain a map which describes the seafloor with the most possible detailed frontiers. Then, we present the obtained results considering five texture classes: rocks, megaripples, sand, mud and shadow. These several areas and their frontiers are the basis landmarks to match the images. However, before using the segmentation, we must check its reliability. So, it appears that the frontiers, though they are realistic, are not accurate enough to make a registration precise to few pixels, especially in rock areas. Similarly, according to the orientation of the ripples, they may be seen as ripples or sand. These observations are due to the directivity of the sonar, which caused these effects on the segmentation. To do registration, we must take into account these problems. So, the results of the segmentation will be used only for a coarse registration, in order to find quickly the area of interest but also to assess the reliability of our registration (matching on ripples areas is a priori less reliable than on rocks areas). The results of registration are shown, proving the good adequacy between reference image and test image. Others methods, more quantitative, will be able to be tested, to refine the results.","11","image classification - image registration - image segmentation - rocks - sand - sonar imaging - underwater vehicles","sidescan sonar image classification - sidescan sonar image segmentation - sonar image registration - AUV - autonomous underwater vehicles - navigation sensor drift correction - image property - spatial variability - temporal variability - sonar geometry - sand megaripples - seafloor physics - evanescent objects - fish - sediments - seabottom dynamics - TVG effects - time varying gain effects - data despeckelised - image processing - supervised method - Gabor filters - linear discriminant analysis - nearest neighbour method - texture class - rocks - mud - shadow position - reference image - test image","A9365 Data and information; acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination in geophysics - B7710D Oceanographic and hydrological techniques and equipment - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6320E Sonar and acoustic radar","B63B - B63G8/00 - G01S15/00 - G01V - G06T - G01S17/66","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Physics (A); Electrical/Electronic engineering (B)","Inspec","Copyright 2005, IEE","Engineering Village"

In this research, we extend the continuous localization technique by adding a learning component. This allows continuous localization to update the long-term map (evidence grid) with current sensor readings. Results show that the addition of the learning behavior to continuous localization allows the system to adapt to changes in its environment without a loss in its ability to remain localized.

This problem is difficult because of the following paradox: to move precisely, a mobile robot must have an accurate environment map; however, to build an accurate map, the mobile robot's sensing locations must be known precisely. In this way, simultaneous map building and localization can be seen to present a question of `which came first, the chicken or the egg?' (The map or the motion?) When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning.","17","computerised navigation - mobile robots - planning (artificial intelligence)","path planning - computerised navigation - map building - localization - autonomous mobile robot - long-term globally referenced position estimation - ultrasonic sensing - multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors - precise positioning","C3390 Robotics - C7420 Control engineering computing","G05B15/00","Practical (PRA)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 1992, IEE","Engineering Village"

While Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most fundamental problems for robotic autonomy, most existing SLAM works are evaluated with data sequences that are recorded in a short period of time. In real-world deployment, there can be out-of-sight scene changes caused by both natural factors and human activities. For example, in home scenarios, most objects may be movable, replaceable or deformable, and the visual features of the same place may be significantly different in some successive days. Such out-of-sight dynamics pose great challenges to the robustness of pose estimation, and hence a robot's long-term deployment and operation. To differentiate the forementioned problem from the conventional works which are usually evaluated in a static setting in a single run, the term lifelong SLAM is used here to address SLAM problems in an ever-changing environment over a long period of time. To accelerate lifelong SLAM research, we release the OpenLORIS-Scene datasets. The data are collected in real-world indoor scenes, for multiple times in each place to include scene changes in real life. We also design benchmarking metrics for lifelong SLAM, with which the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation are evaluated separately.

A pre-built map that does not account for these changes becomes out-of-date easily. Therefore, it is necessary to have an up-to-date model of the environment to facilitate long-term operation of a robot. To this end, this paper presents a general lifelong simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. Our framework uses a multiple session map representation, and exploits an efficient map updating strategy that includes map building, pose graph refinement and sparsification. To mitigate the unbounded increase of memory usage, we propose a map-trimming method based on the Chow-Liu maximum-mutual-information spanning tree. The proposed SLAM framework has been comprehensively validated by over a month of robot deployment in real supermarket environment. Furthermore, we release the dataset collected from the indoor and outdoor changing environment with the hope to accelerate lifelong SLAM research in the community.

Adaptive local maps is an algorithm which represents the occupancy information as a set of overlapping local maps anchored to poses in the robot's trajectory. At any time, a global occupancy map can be rendered from the local maps to be used for path planning. The advantage of this approach is that the occupancy information stays consistent despite the changes in the pose estimates resulting from loop closures and localization updates. The disadvantage, however, is that the number of local maps grows over time. For long robot runs, or for multiple runs in the same space, this growth will result in redundant occupancy information, which will in turn increase the time it takes to render the global map, as well as the memory footprint of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the maintenance of an adaptive local maps system, which intelligently prunes redundant local maps, ensuring the robustness and stability required for lifelong mapping.","31","mobile robots - path planning - pose estimation - SLAM (robots)","lifelong mapping - occupancy mapping - mobile robot - intelligent planning decisions - overlapping local maps - global occupancy map - localization updates - long robot runs - redundant occupancy information - adaptive local maps system - redundant local maps - robot trajectory","B6135E Image recognition - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, “everything changes and nothing stands still, ” and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a flexible, computationally efficient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for lifelong environmental modeling in an ever-changing world.","27","adaptive systems - Bayes methods - recursive estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","lifelong feature-based mapping - feature-based graphical approach - robotic mapping - autonomous agent - localization system - adaptive system - expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model - abstract semistatic environmental features - recursive Bayesian estimator - persistence filter - explicit Bayesian belief - feature persistence estimation - graphical mapping - lifelong environmental modeling","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1340E Self-adjusting control systems - C1140Z Other topics in statistics","G05B13/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

As a result, traditional graph-based SLAM approaches eventually become extremely slow due to the continuous growth of the graph and the loss of sparsity. Both problems can be addressed by a graph pruning algorithm. It carefully removes vertices and edges to keep the graph size reasonable while preserving the information needed to provide good SLAM results. We propose a novel method that considers geometric criteria for choosing the vertices to be pruned. It is efficient, easy to implement, and leads to a graph with evenly spread vertices that remain part of the robot trajectory. Furthermore, we present a novel approach of marginalization that is more robust to wrong loop closures than existing methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two publicly available real-world long-term datasets and compared to the unpruned case as well as ground truth. We show that even on a long dataset (25h), our approach manages to keep the graph sparse and the speed high while still providing good accuracy (40 times speed up, 6cm map error compared to unpruned case).","0","geometry - graph theory - SLAM (robots) - trajectory control","mapped locations - robot trajectory - real-world long-term datasets - geometry-based graph pruning - lifelong SLAM","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390 Robotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics","G05D3/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The system should update maps with new information; while also keeping track of older observations. But, mapping for a long time can require higher computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of life-long SLAM. We represent the global map as a set of rasterized images of local maps along with a map management system responsible for updating local maps and keeping track of older values.

For an aerial or underwater vehicle, undulating terrain of a land or seabed surface is a valuable information resource that leads to the development of terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) algorithms. However, due to the vast amount of a vehicle's activity area, surveying all the regions to obtain a high-resolution terrain map is impractical and requires simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) as a highly desirable capability. This paper presents a topographic SLAM algorithm using only a single terrain altimeter, which is low-cost, computationally efficient, and sufficiently stable for long-term operation. The proposed rectangular panel map structure and update method enable robust and efficient SLAM. As terrain elevation changes are inherently nonlinear, an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM filter is adopted. The feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through simulations using terrain elevation data from a real-world undersea environment.","0","altimeters - Kalman filters - mobile robots - navigation - nonlinear filters - satellite navigation - SLAM (robots) - telecommunication control - terrain mapping","single terrain altimeter - GNSS-restricted environment - mobile robot navigation system - environment information - aerial vehicle - underwater vehicle - undulating terrain - valuable information resource - terrain-referenced navigation algorithms - high-resolution terrain map - topographic SLAM algorithm - rectangular panel map structure - terrain elevation changes - extended Kalman filter-based SLAM filter - terrain elevation data - real-world undersea environment - global navigation satellite system-restricted area - TRN algorithms - vehicle activity area - simultaneous localization and mapping - EKF-based SLAM filter","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B7250G Display, recording and indicating instruments - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - C3370H Control applications in radio and radar - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260 Digital signal processing","G01C5/00 - G01C21/00 - G01D7/00 - G01D9/00 - G01S - G01S5/02 - G05D1/00 - H04W28/02 - G01S19/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The offline mapping fuses data from multiple visually varied datasets, thus dealing with changing environments by incorporating new information. Before passing these data to the online localization system, the map is summarized, selecting only the landmarks that are deemed useful for localization. This Summary Map enables online localization that is accurate and robust to the variation of visual information in natural environments while still being computationally efficient.

Long-term navigation of robots in outdoor environments introduces new challenges to enable life-long SLAM, including the strong appearance change resulting from vegetation, weather, and illumination variations across various times of the day, different days, months, or even seasons. In this paper, we propose a new shared representative appearance learning (SRAL) approach to address long-term visual place recognition. Different from previous methods using a single feature modality or a concatenation of multiple features, our SRAL method autonomously learns representative features that are shared in all scene scenarios, and then fuses the features together to represent the long-term appearance of environments observed by a robot during life-long navigation. By formulating SRAL as a regularized optimization problem, we use structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of feature modalities. In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the formulated optimization problem, which holds a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive empirical study was performed to evaluate the SRAL method using large-scale benchmark datasets, including St Lucia, CMU-VL, and Nordland datasets. Experimental results have shown that our SRAL method obtains superior performance for life-long place recognition using individual images, outperforms previous single image-based methods, and is capable of estimating the importance of feature modalities.","38","feature extraction - image fusion - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - object detection - object recognition - optimisation - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","large-scale benchmark datasets - Nordland dataset - CMU-VL dataset - St Lucia dataset - feature modalities - structured sparsity-inducing norms - regularized optimization problem - feature fusion - illumination variation - weather variation - vegetation variation - long-term robot navigation - visual SLAM - visual simultaneous localization-and-mapping - loop closure detection - long-term visual place recognition - shared representative appearance learning - SRAL","B6135E Image recognition - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260A Sensor fusion","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06F15/18 - G06T - B60W30/095 - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In the near future, smart cities will perform intelligent autonomous monitoring of buried pipe networks, using teams of small robots. These robots, equipped with all necessary computational facilities and sensors (optical, acoustic, inertial, thermal, pressure and others) will be able to inspect pipes whilst navigating, self-localising and communicating information about the pipe condition and faults such as leaks or blockages to human operators for monitoring and decision support. The predominantly manual inspection of pipe networks will be replaced with teams of autonomous inspection robots that can operate for long periods of time over a large spatial scale. Reliable autonomous navigation and reporting of faults at this scale requires effective localization and mapping, which is the estimation of the robot's position and its surrounding environment. This survey presents an overview of state-of-the-art works on robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with a focus on water and sewer pipe networks. It considers various aspects of the SLAM problem in pipes, from the motivation, to the water industry requirements, modern SLAM methods, map-types and sensors suited to pipes. Future challenges such as robustness for long term robot operation in pipes are discussed, including how making use of prior knowledge, e.g. geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to build map estimates, and improve multi-robot SLAM in the pipe environment.","0","inspection - mobile robots - multi-robot systems - navigation - path planning - pipes - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","map-types and sensors - water industry requirements - water pipe networks - multirobot SLAM - long term robot operation - robot simultaneous localization and mapping - autonomous inspection robots - predominantly manual inspection - intelligent autonomous monitoring - sewer pipe networks","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - E1610 Inspection and quality control - E2210 Mechanical components","F16L - G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","General or Review (GEN); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, using only bathymetric data in unknown environment has its own disadvantages, that are low precision and large computational load. To tackle with requirements of high-precision navigation under large-scale and long-term voyage condition, a SLAM method and corresponding matching algorithm for integrating multi-geophysical field data are proposed. By dividing the feature data and location data of geophysical field obtained into various submaps and sub-segments during AUV sailing, the dominant navigation data of each segment is identified using long short-term memory network. Validity of the proposed method is done by simulation experiments. During the simulation, the loop closure detection of each submap is used, and the matching counter is set to check the correct matching rate. Finally, the matching results with single geophysics field data under the same conditions are compared with multi-geophysics field data and analyzed. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method.","26","autonomous underwater vehicles - geophysics computing - image matching - mobile robots - path planning - recurrent neural nets - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","short-term memory network - matching counter - single geophysics field data - segmented matching method - multigeophysics field SLAM data - autonomous underwater vehicles - long-term navigation - bathymetric data - high-precision navigation - long-term voyage condition - dominant navigation data - LSTM - simultaneous localization and mapping - loop closure detection","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360J Marine system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C7420 Control engineering computing - C7340 Geophysics computing - C6264 - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05B15/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

It is well known, however, that with long exploratory trajectories and multi-session mapping for long-term autonomy or collaborative applications, the maintenance of the ever-increasing size of these maps quickly becomes a bottleneck. With the explosion of data resulting in increasing runtime of the optimization algorithms ensuring the accuracy of the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) estimates, the large quantity of collected experiences is imposing hard limits on the scalability of such techniques. Considering the keyframe-based paradigm of SLAM techniques, this paper investigates the redundancy inherent in SLAM maps, by quantifying the information of different experiences of the scene as encoded in keyframes. Here we propose and evaluate different information-theoretic and heuristic metrics to remove dispensable scene measurements with minimal impact on the accuracy of the SLAM estimates. Evaluating the proposed metrics in two state-of-the-art centralized collaborative SLAM systems, we provide our key insights into how to identify redundancy in keyframe-based SLAM.","34","graph theory - information theory - mobile robots - optimisation - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - virtual reality","virtual reality - mobile phones - head-mounted displays - optimization algorithms - scene measurements - redundancy detection - automating robot navigation - collaborative SLAM systems - information-theoretic - simultaneous localization and mapping","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6130V Virtual reality - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C1260 Information theory - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Corresponding scenarios include households, offices, warehouses and parking lots, where the location of certain objects such as goods, furniture or cars can change over time. These changes typically lead to inconsistent observations with respect to previously learned maps and thus decrease the localization accuracy or even prevent the robot from globally localizing itself. In this paper we present a soundprobabilistic approach to lifelong localization in changing environments using a combination ofa Rao-Blackwellizedparticlefilter with a hidden Markov model. By exploiting several properties of this model, we obtain a highly efficient map management approach for dynamic environments, which makes it feasible to run our algorithm online.

In this paper, we introduce semantic mapping and lifelong localization approaches to recognize semi-dynamic objects in non-static environments. We also propose a generic framework that can integrate mainstream object detection algorithms with mapping and localization algorithms. The mapping method combines an object detection algorithm and a SLAM algorithm to detect semi-dynamic objects and constructs a semantic map that only contains semi-dynamic objects in the environment. During navigation, the localization method can classify observation corresponding to static and non-static objects respectively and evaluate whether those semi-dynamic objects have moved, to reduce the weight of invalid observation and localization fluctuation.

As each application brings its own set of constraints on sensors, processing capabilities, and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power, and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual- or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors.

As a supplement of vehicle-borne and air-borne methods, Backpack mobile mapping system (MMS) has a wide application prospect in indoor and underground space. High-precision positioning and attitude determination are the key to MMS. Usually, GNSS/INS integrated navigation system provides reliable pose information. However, in the GNSS-denied environments, there is no effective long-term positioning method. With the development of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, it provides a new solution for indoor mobile mapping. This paper develops a portable backpack mobile mapping system, which integrates multi-sensor such as LiDAR, IMU, GNSS and panoramic camera. The 3D laser SLAM algorithm is applied to the mobile mapping to realize the acquisition of geographic information data in various complex environments. The experimental results in typical indoor and outdoor scenes show that the system can achieve high-precision and efficient acquisition of 3D information, and the relative precision of point cloud is 2~4cm, which meets the requirements of scene mapping and reconstruction.","10","cameras - geographic information systems - image fusion - image reconstruction - indoor navigation - inertial navigation - mobile computing - optical radar - satellite navigation - SLAM (robots)","SLAM-based backpack mobile mapping system - spatial data - backpack MMS - indoor space - underground space - attitude determination - GNSS-denied environments - long-term positioning method - indoor mobile mapping - portable backpack mobile mapping system - 3D laser SLAM algorithm - geographic information data - complex environments - typical indoor scenes - outdoor scenes - scene mapping - high-precision positioning - GNSS-INS integrated navigation system - simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm - LiDAR - IMU - panoramic camera - scene reconstruction","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6320C Optical radar - C6190V Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C7840 Geography and cartography computing","G01C21/00 - G01P7/00 - G01S - G01S5/02 - G01S17/00 - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G06F9/44 - G06T - G01C21/16 - G01S19/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Our algorithm selects points which provide the highest reduction in Shannon entropy between the entropy of the current state and the joint entropy of the state, given the addition of the new feature with the classification entropy of the feature from a Bayesian neural network. Each selected feature significantly reduces the uncertainty of the vehicle state and has been detected to be a static object (building, traffic sign, etc.) repeatedly with a high confidence. This selection strategy generates a sparse map which can facilitate long-term localization. The KITTI odometry dataset is used to evaluate our method, and we also compare our results against ORB_SLAM2.

It is a fundamental kernel that enables head-mounted augmented/virtual reality devices and autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles. A noticeable recent trend in visual SLAM is to apply computationand memory-intensive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that outperform traditional hand-designed feature-based methods [1]. For each video frame, CNN-extracted features are matched with stored keypoints to estimate the agent's 6-DoF pose by solving a perspective-n-points (PnP) non-linear optimization problem (Fig. 7.3.1, left). The agent's long-term trajectory over multiple frames is refined by a bundle adjustment process (BA, Fig. 7.3.1 right), which involves a large-scale (~120 variables) non-linear optimization. Visual SLAM requires massive computation (>250GOP/s) in the CNN-based feature extraction and matching, as well as datadependent dynamic memory access and control flow with high-precision operations, creating significant low-power design challenges. Software implementations are impractical, resulting in 0.2s runtime with a ~3GHz CPU+ GPU system with >100MB memory footprint and >100W power consumption. Prior ASICs have implemented either an incomplete SLAM system [2,3] that lacks estimation of ego-motion or employed a simplified (non-CNN) feature extraction and tracking [2,4,5] that limits SLAM quality and range. A recent ASIC [5] augments visual SLAM with an off-chip high-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU), simplifying the computational complexity, but incurring additional power and cost overhead.","5","augmented reality - cameras - convolutional neural nets - feature extraction - mobile robots - path planning - pose estimation - power consumption - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","879GOPS 243mW 80fps - fully visual CNN-SLAM processor - autonomous navigation - microaerial vehicles - video frame - CNN-extracted features - perspective-n-points nonlinear optimization problem - long-term trajectory - bundle adjustment process - large-scale nonlinear optimization - high-precision operations - low-power design challenges - incomplete SLAM system - memory footprint - power consumption - visual SLAM - nonCNN feature extraction - CPU+ GPU system - head-mounted virtual reality devices - head-mounted augmented reality devices - data-dependent dynamic memory access - off-chip high-precision inertial measurement unit - computational complexity - power 243.0 mW","B6135E Image recognition - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5290 Neural computing techniques - C6130V Virtual reality - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06F15/18 - G06K9/00 - G06T - B60W30/095 - G06N5/04 - G06N3/02","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

To achieve the required localization accuracy and availability, long-term visual SLAM algorithms like LLama-SLAM are a promising option. In such algorithms visual feature tracks, i. e. landmark observations over several consecutive image frames, have to be matched to feature tracks recorded days, weeks or months earlier. This leads to a more challenging matching problem than in short-term visual localization and known descriptor matching methods cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we devise several approaches to compare and match feature tracks and evaluate their performance on a long-term data set. With the proposed descriptor combination and masking ('CoMa') method the best track matching performance is achieved with minor computational cost. This method creates a single combined descriptor for each feature track and furthermore increases the robustness by capturing the appearance variations of this track in a descriptor mask.","21","feature extraction - image matching - mobile robots - pose estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","visual features - automotive long-term SLAM - vital prerequisite - future assistance - autonomous driving functions - LLama-SLAM - consecutive image frames - feature track - challenging matching problem - short-term visual localization - matching methods - long-term data - track matching performance - visual feature tracks","B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

While the Localization and Mapping problem for single sessions can be efficiently solved with many state of the art solutions, place recognition in natural environments still poses great challenges for the perception system of a robotic agent. In this paper we propose a relocalization pipeline which exploits both 3D and visual information from stereo cameras to detect matches across local point clouds of multiple SLAM sessions. Our solution is based on a Bag of Binary Words scheme where binarized SHOT descriptors are enriched with visual cues to recall in a fast and efficient way previously visited places.

The principal difficulty in long-term localization arises from the dynamic changes that affect outdoor environments. In this work, we propose a new approach for outdoor large scale image-based localization that can deal with challenging scenarios like cross-season, cross-weather and day/night localization. The key component of our method is a new learned global image descriptor, that can effectively benefit from scene geometry information during training. At test time, our system is capable of inferring the depth map related to the query image and use it to increase localization accuracy. We show through extensive evaluation that our method can improve localization performances, especially in challenging scenarios when the visual appearance of the scene has changed. Our method is able to leverage both visual and geometric clues from monocular images to create discriminative descriptors for cross-season localization and effective matching of images acquired at different time periods. Our method can also use weakly annotated data to localize night images across a reference dataset of daytime images. Finally we extended our method to reflectance modality and we compare multi-modal descriptors respectively based on geometry, material reflectance and a combination of both.","89","computer vision - feature extraction - image classification - image colour analysis - image matching - image recognition - image representation - image retrieval - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - object detection - object recognition - path planning - robot vision","principal difficulty - long-term localization - dynamic changes - outdoor environments - outdoor large scale image-based localization - cross-weather - learned global image descriptor - scene geometry information - query image - localization accuracy - localization performances - visual appearance - visual clues - geometric clues - monocular images - cross-season localization - night images - daytime images - multimodal descriptors - image description - auxiliary modality - visual localization - image indexing - lifelong localization - robot navigation - autonomous driving heritage valorization - cultural heritage valorization","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C7250R Information retrieval techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - B60W30/095 - G06N20/00 - G06F16/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

We derive LG-ESDSF and demonstrate that it retains all the good characteristics of the classic Euclidean ESDSF, the main advantage being the exact sparsity of the information matrix. The key advantage of LG-ESDSF in comparison with the classic ESDSF lies in the ability to respect the state space geometry by negotiating uncertainties and employing filtering equations directly on Lie groups. We also exploit the special structure of the information matrix in order to allow long-term operation while the robot is moving repeatedly through the same environment. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed SLAM solution, we conducted extensive experiments on two different publicly available datasets, namely the KITTI and EuRoC datasets, using two front-ends: one based on the stereo camera and the other on the 3D LIDAR. We compare LG-ESDSF with the general graph optimization framework (g2o) when coupled with the same front-ends. Similarly to g2o the proposed LG-ESDSF is front-end agnostic and the comparison demonstrates that our solution can match the accuracy of g2o, while maintaining faster computation times. Furthermore, the proposed back-end coupled with the stereo camera front-end forms a complete visual SLAM solution dubbed LG-SLAM. Finally, we evaluated LG-SLAM using the online KITTI protocol and at the time of writing it achieved the second best result among the stereo odometry solutions and the best result among the tested SLAM algorithms.","71","cameras - geometry - graph theory - Lie groups - matrix algebra - mobile robots - optimisation - SLAM (robots)","exactly sparse delayed state filter - LG-SLAM - Lie groups - uncertainties - state space geometry - LG-ESDSF - information matrix - stereo odometry solutions - online KITTI protocol - stereo camera front-end - graph optimization framework - 3D LIDAR - EuRoC datasets - simultaneous localization and mapping back-end solution - long-term pose graph SLAM - visual SLAM solution - Euclidean ESDSF - filtering equations","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0260 Optimisation techniques - B0210 Algebra - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C1110 Algebra - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390C Mobile robots","G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Using common GNSS the ego position can be measured but not with the reliability and precision necessary. An alternative approach to achieve precise localization is the usage of visual landmarks observed by a camera mounted in the vehicle. However, this raises the necessity of reliable visual landmarks that are easily recognizable and persistent. We propose a novel SLAM algorithm that focuses on learning and mapping such visual long-term landmarks (LLamas). The algorithm therefore processes stereo image streams from several recording sessions in the same spatial area. The key part within LLama-SLAM is the assessment of the landmarks with quality values that are inferred as viewpoint dependent probabilities from observation statistics. By adding solely landmarks of high quality to the final LLama Map, it can be kept compact while still allowing reliable localization. Due to the long-term evaluation of the GNSS measurement during the sessions, the landmarks can be positioned precisely in a global referenced coordinate system. For a first assessment of the algorithm's capabilities, we present some experimental results from the mapping process combining three sessions recorded over two months on the same route.","26","control engineering computing - driver information systems - mobile robots - probability - road traffic control - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - statistics - stereo image processing","LLama-SLAM - autonomous driving - stereo image streams - GNSS measurement - statistics - high-quality visual landmark learning - long-term mapping and localization - GNSS - visual long-term landmarks - r advanced driver assistance systems","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0240Z Other topics in statistics - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C7420 Control engineering computing - C7445 Traffic engineering computing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1140Z Other topics in statistics","B60W - G05B15/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T - G08G1/00 - G08G1/09 - H04N13/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Hence, this paper presents a semantic and geometric constraints VSLAM (SGC-VSLAM), which is built on the RGB-D mode of ORB-SLAM2 with the addition of dynamic detection and static point cloud map construction modules. In detail, a novel improved quadtree-based method was adopted for SGC-VSLAM to enhance the performance of the feature extractor in ORB-SLAM (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF-SLAM). Moreover, a new dynamic feature detection method called semantic and geometric constraints was proposed, which provided a robust and fast way to filter dynamic features. The semantic bounding box generated by YOLO v3 (You Only Look Once, v3) was used to calculate a more accurate fundamental matrix between adjacent frames, which was then used to filter all of the truly dynamic features. Finally, a static point cloud was estimated by using a new drawing key frame selection strategy. Experiments on the public TUM RGB-D (Red-Green-Blue Depth) dataset were conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. This evaluation revealed that the proposed SGC-VSLAM can effectively improve the positioning accuracy of the ORB-SLAM2 system in high-dynamic scenarios and was also able to build a map with the static parts of the real environment, which has long-term application value for autonomous mobile robots.","38","feature extraction - image colour analysis - mobile robots - quadtrees - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","SGC-VSLAM - dynamic indoor environments - autonomous mobile robots - state-of-the-art VSLAM - strong scene rigidity assumption - independent dynamic objects - semantic constraints VSLAM - geometric constraints VSLAM - dynamic detection - static point cloud map construction modules - dynamic feature detection method - semantic bounding box - truly dynamic features - ORB-SLAM2 system - high-dynamic scenarios","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Almost all existing methods are designed to work with traditional cameras with a limited field of view. Recent advances in omnidirectional sensors offer a robot an opportunity to perceive the entire surrounding environment. However, no work has existed thus far to research how omnidirectional sensors can help long-term place recognition, especially when multiple types of omnidirectional sensory data are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to integrate observations obtained from multiple sensors from different viewing angles in the omnidirectional observation in order to perform multi-directional place recognition in longterm autonomy. Our approach also answers two new questions when omnidirectional multisensory data is available for place recognition, including whether it is possible to recognize a place with long-term appearance variations when robots approach it from various directions, and whether observations from various viewing angles are the same informative. To evaluate our approach and hypothesis, we have collected the first large-scale dataset that consists of omnidirectional multisensory (intensity and depth) data collected in urban and suburban environments across a year. Experimental results have shown that our approach is able to achieve multi-directional long-term place recognition, and identifies the most discriminative viewing angles from the omnidirectional observation.","20","mobile robots - object recognition - robot vision - sensor fusion - SLAM (robots)","omnidirectional multisensory perception fusion - long-term place recognition - long-term autonomy - omnidirectional sensors - omnidirectional observation - multidirectional place recognition - omnidirectional multisensory data - appearance variations - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping","B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260A Sensor fusion - C7420 Control engineering computing","G05B15/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The scheme of the cooperative localization algorithm depends on the ability of information interaction between the robots. To solve the problem that the cooperative localization accuracy is obviously reduced when the communication is interrupted for a long time between the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), the simultaneous localization and tracking (SLAT) algorithms based on the FastSLAM framework are developed in this research, borrowing the principle of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. The master AUV is regarded as a non-cooperative target and a motion estimator used to track the master AUV is built in the slaver AUV. When the motion state of the master AUV is estimated, the improvement of the self localization accuracy of the slaver AUV is achieved, using the relative measurement information obtained from the sonar sensor on the slaver AUV in real time.

Moreover, a detailed review of major studies in the literature and our proposed solutions for addressing the problem are presented. The main goal of this paper is the enhancement of the accuracy and robustness of the SLAM-based navigation problem for underwater robotics with low computational costs. Therefore, we present a new method called AEKF-SLAM that employs an Augmented Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF)-based SLAM algorithm. The AEKF-based SLAM approach stores the robot poses and map landmarks in a single state vector, while estimating the state parameters via a recursive and iterative estimation-update process. Hereby, the prediction and update state (which exist as well in the conventional EKF) are complemented by a newly proposed augmentation stage. Applied to underwater robot navigation, the AEKF-SLAM has been compared with the classic and popular FastSLAM 2.0 algorithm. Concerning the dense loop mapping and line mapping experiments, it shows much better performances in map management with respect to landmark addition and removal, which avoid the long-term accumulation of errors and clutters in the created map. Additionally, the underwater robot achieves more precise and efficient self-localization and a mapping of the surrounding landmarks with much lower processing times.

However, tracking failure is still a challenging problem during the monocular SLAM process, and it seems to be even inevitable when carrying out long-term SLAM in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose an active loop closure based relocalization system, which enables the monocular SLAM to detect and recover from tracking failures automatically even in previously unvisited areas where no keyframe exists. We test our system by extensive experiments including using the most popular KITTI dataset, and our own dataset acquired by a hand-held camera in outdoor large-scale and indoor small-scale real-world environments where man-made shakes and interruptions were added. The experimental results show that the least recovery time (within 5 ms) and the longest success distance (up to 46 m) were achieved comparing to other relocalization systems. Furthermore, our system is more robust than others, as it can be used in different kinds of situations, i.e., tracking failures caused by the blur, sudden motion and occlusion. Besides robots or autonomous vehicles, our system can also be employed in other applications, like mobile phones, drones, etc.","26","mobile robots - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","KITTI dataset - robust relocalization systems - simultaneous localization and mapping - monocular SLAM algorithms - large-scale environments - long-term SLAM - monocular SLAM process - real-time monocular SLAM - active loop closure - tracking failure - recovery time - indoor small-scale real-world environments - hand-held camera - time 5.0 ms","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Outdoor visual localization generates large amounts of data that need to be incorporated into a lifelong visual map in order to allow localization at all times and under all appearance conditions. Processing these large quantities of data is non-trivial, as it is subject to limited computational and storage capabilities both on the vehicle and on the mapping backend. We address this problem with a two-fold map update paradigm capable of, either, adding new visual cues to the map, or updating co-observation statistics. The former, in combination with offline map summarization techniques, allows enhancing the appearance coverage of the lifelong map while keeping the map size limited. On the other hand, the latter is able to significantly boost the appearance-based landmark selection for efficient online localization without incurring any additional computational or storage burden. Our evaluation in challenging outdoor conditions shows that our proposed map management process allows building and maintaining maps for precise visual localization over long time spans in a tractable and scalable fashion.","22","automobiles - mobile robots - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","appearance-based landmark selection - visual localization system - multivehicle long-term operations - resource constrained outdoor environments - outdoor visual localization - lifelong visual map - appearance conditions - mapping backend - two-fold map update paradigm - visual cues - offline map summarization techniques - appearance coverage - long-term visual localization - map management process - autonomous cars","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360B Road-traffic system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","B60W - B62D - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - G08G1/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The state-of-the-art localization methods adopt visual and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to estimate the position of the vehicle. However, both of them may suffer from error accumulation due to long-term running without loop optimization or prior constraints. Actually, the vehicle cannot always return to the revisited location, which will cause errors to accumulate in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-challenged environments. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel localization method with prior dense visual point cloud map constraints generated by a stereo camera. Firstly, the semi-global-block-matching (SGBM) algorithm is adopted to estimate the visual point cloud of each frame and stereo visual odometry is used to provide the initial position for the current visual point cloud. Secondly, multiple filtering and adaptive prior map segmentation are performed on the prior dense visual point cloud map for fast matching and localization. Then, the current visual point cloud is matched with the candidate sub-map by normal distribution transformation (NDT). Finally, the matching result is used to update pose prediction based on the last frame for accurate localization. Comprehensive experiments were undertaken to validate the proposed method, showing that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of translation and rotation are less than 5.59 m and 0.08°, respectively.","46","cameras - distance measurement - image matching - image reconstruction - mobile robots - object detection - optical radar - robot vision - satellite navigation - SLAM (robots) - stereo image processing - traffic engineering computing","autonomous vehicle localization - prior visual point cloud map constraints - GNSS-challenged environments - accurate vehicle ego-localization - autonomous vehicles - high-level navigation tasks - state-of-the-art localization methods - error accumulation - long-term running - prior constraints - Global Navigation Satellite System-challenged environments - novel localization method - prior dense visual point cloud map constraints - semiglobal-block-matching algorithm - stereo visual odometry - current visual point cloud - adaptive prior map segmentation - fast matching - candidate sub-map - size 5.59 m","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6135E Image recognition - B6320C Optical radar - B0290F Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C7445 Traffic engineering computing - C3390C Mobile robots","G01S5/02 - G01S17/00 - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T - H04N13/00 - G01S19/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The popular method, Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) addresses the problem by iteratively updating a set of particles with a “sampling-weighting” loop. Sampling is decisive to the performance of MCL [1]. However, traditional MCL can only sample from a uniform distribution over the state space. Although variants of MCL propose different sampling models, they fail to provide an accurate distribution or generalize across scenes. To better deal with these problems, we present a distribution proposal model named Deep Samplable Observation Model (DSOM). DSOM takes a map and a 2D laser scan as inputs and outputs a conditional multimodal probability distribution of the pose, making the samples more focusing on the regions with higher likelihood. With such samples, the convergence is expected to be more effective and efficient. Considering that the learning-based sampling model may fail to capture the accurate pose sometimes, we furthermore propose the Adaptive Mixture MCL (AdaM MCL), which deploys a trusty mechanism to adaptively select updating mode for each particle to tolerate this situation. Equipped with DSOM, AdaM MCL can achieve more accurate estimation, faster convergence and better scalability than previous methods in both synthetic and real scenes.

Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework.

However, repeated and similar scenes (perceptual aliasing) and long term appearance changes (e.g. weather variations) are major challenges for current place recognition algorithms. We introduce a new dataset Multisensory Omnidirectional Long-term Place recognition (MOLP) comprising omnidirectional intensity and disparity images. This dataset presents many of the challenges faced by outdoor mobile robots and current place recognition algorithms. Using MOLP dataset, we formulate the place recognition problem as a regularized sparse convex optimization problem. We conclude that information extracted from intensity image is superior to disparity image in isolating discriminative features for successful long term place recognition. Furthermore, when these discriminative features are extracted from an omnidirectional vision sensor, a robust bidirectional loop closure detection approach is established, allowing mobile robots to close the loop, regardless of the difference in the direction when revisiting a place.","25","convex programming - feature extraction - image sensors - object detection - object recognition","multisensory omnidirectional long-term place recognition - place recognition - loop closure detection - fully autonomous mobile robots - self-driving vehicle navigation - simultaneous localization and mapping techniques - SLAM - perceptual aliasing - appearance change - MOLP - regularized sparse convex optimization problem - discriminative feature isolation - omnidirectional vision sensor","B6135E Image recognition - B7230G Image sensors - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques","G06T - H01L27/146 - H04N5/30","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, because they are hand-designed, a natural question is whether they are globally optimal control policies. In this work we explore the performance of Neuroevolution - specifically NEAT - at evolving control policies for simulated differential drive robots carrying out generalised maze navigation. We extend NEAT to include Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to help deal with long term dependencies. We show that both NEAT and our NEAT-GRU can repeatably generate controllers that outperform I-Bug (an algorithm particularly well-suited for use in real robots) on a test set of 209 indoor maze like environments.

However, map built by Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) doesn't have high global consistency which is not suitable for long-term application in large scene. To address the problem, we present an improved RBPF Lidar SLAM system with loop detection and correction named LCPF. The efficiency and accuracy of loop detection depend on the segmentation of submaps. Instead of dividing the submap at fixed number of laser scan like existing method, Dynamic Submap Segmentation is proposed in LCPF. This segmentation algorithm decreases the error inside the submap by splitting the submap where there is high scan match error and later rectifies the error by an improved pose graph optimization between submaps. In order to segment the submap at appropriate point, when to create a new submap is determined by both the accumulation of scan match error and the particle distribution. Furthermore, LCPF uses branch and bound algorithm as basic detector for loop detection and multiple criteria to judge the reliability of a loop. In the criteria, a novel parameter called usable ratio was proposed to measure the useful information that a laser scan containing. Finally, comparisons to existing 2D-Lidar mapping algorithm are performed with a series of open dataset simulations and real robot experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of LCPF.","25","graph theory - image segmentation - mobile robots - optical radar - particle filtering (numerical methods) - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","loop detection - globally consistent map - indoor robot localization - navigation - Rao-Blackwellized particle filter - high global consistency - LCPF - laser scan - segmentation algorithm - high scan match error - particle filter lidar SLAM system - 2D-lidar mapping algorithm - dynamic submap segmentation - improved RBPF lidar SLAM system","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B6320C Optical radar - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Overtime, the metallic pipes are prone to corrosion, which can lead to water leakage and pipe bursts. In order to prolong the service life of those assets, water utilities in Australia apply protective pipe linings. Long-term monitoring and timely intervention are crucial for maintaining those lining assets. However, the water utilities do not possess the comprehensive technology to achieve it. The main reasons for lacking such technology are the unavailability of sensors and accurate robot localization technologies. Feature based localization methods such as SLAM has limited use as the application of liners alters the features and the environment. Encoder based localization is not accurate enough to observe the evolution of defects over a long period of time requiring unique defect correspondence. This motivates us to explore accurate contact-less and wireless based localization methods. We propose a cost-effective localization method using UHF-RFID signals for robot localization inside pipelines based on Gaussian process combined particle filter. Experiments carried out in field extracted pipe samples from the Sydney water pipe network show that using the RSSI and Phase data together in the measurement model with particle filter algorithm improves the localization accuracy up to 15 centimeters precision.","0","condition monitoring - flaw detection - Gaussian processes - particle filtering (numerical methods) - pipelines - radiofrequency identification - SLAM (robots)","Sydney water pipe network - localization accuracy - pipe samples - Gaussian process combined particle filter - cost-effective localization method - wireless based localization methods - unique defect correspondence - encoder based localization - accurate robot localization technologies - lining assets - long-term monitoring - protective pipe linings - water utilities - service life - pipe bursts - water leakage - metallic pipes - underground water pipes - pipelines - UHF-RFID signals","B0590 Materials testing - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0240G Monte Carlo methods - B0240J Markov processes - B0290F Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - B6250L RFID systems - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1140G Monte Carlo methods - C1140J Markov processes - C3390 Robotics - C4130 Interpolation and function approximation (numerical analysis) - E3040 Public utilities - E0210J Statistics - E0210L Numerical analysis - E1020 Maintenance and reliability - E1550A Robotics - E1610 Inspection and quality control - E1630 Testing","F17D1/00 - G01N - G01N21/88 - G06T - H04B7/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Our method assumes very little a priori knowledge, and it does not require the aid of acoustic beacons for navigation, which is a typical mode of navigation in this type of application. Our system combines recent techniques in underwater saliency-informed visual SLAM and a method for representing the ship hull surface as a collection of many locally planar surface features. This methodology produces accurate maps that can be constructed in real-time on consumer-grade computing hardware. A single-session SLAM result is initially used as a prior map for later sessions, where the robot automatically merges the multiple surveys into a common hull-relative reference frame. To perform the relocalization step, we use a particle filter that leverages the locally planar representation of the ship hull surface, and a fast visual descriptor matching algorithm. Finally, we apply the recently developed graph sparsification tool, generic linear constraints, as a way to manage the computational complexity of the SLAM system as the robot accumulates information across multiple sessions. We show results for 20 SLAM sessions for two large vessels over the course of days, months, and even up to three years, with a total path length of approximately 10.2 km.","63","autonomous underwater vehicles - graph theory - mobile robots - particle filtering (numerical methods) - ships - SLAM (robots) - telerobotics - video surveillance","long term mapping techniques - ship hull inspection - ship hull surveillance - autonomous underwater vehicle - multiple session hull inspection - simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM - acoustic beacons - consumer grade computing hardware - particle filter - locally planar representation - visual descriptor matching algorithm - generic linear constraints - graph sparsification tool - computational complexity - SLAM system","B6430 Television and video equipment, systems and applications - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - C3360J Marine system control - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics","B63B - G05D1/00 - H04N5/00 - H04N7/00","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This paper deals with the problems of long-term underwater navigation for AUVs and provides new mapping techniques by developing a Bathymetric Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (BSLAM) method based on graph SLAM technology. To considerably reduce the calculation cost, the trajectory of the AUV is divided into various submaps based on Differences of Normals (DoN). Loop closures between submaps are obtained by terrain matching; meanwhile, maximum likelihood terrain estimation is also introduced to build weak data association within the submap. Assisted by one weight voting method for loop closures, the global and local trajectory corrections work together to provide an accurate navigation solution for AUVs with weak data association and inaccurate loop closures. The viability, accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed algorithm are verified with data collected onboard, including an 8 km planned track recorded at a speed of 4 knots in Qingdao, China.","32","autonomous underwater vehicles - Global Positioning System - mobile robots - navigation - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - terrain mapping","global trajectory corrections - weight voting method - weak data association - maximum likelihood terrain estimation - submap - graph SLAM technology - mapping techniques - long-term underwater navigation - autonomous underwater vehicles - geological surveys - topographic mapping missions - graph method - terrain matching - DoN - BSLAM - differences of normals - AUV bathymetric simultaneous localisation and mapping - navigation solution - local trajectory corrections","A9385 Instrumentation and techniques for geophysical, hydrospheric and lower atmosphere research - B7710 Geophysical techniques and equipment - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C7840 Geography and cartography computing - C3360J Marine system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01C21/00 - G01V - G05D1/00 - G06T - G01S19/01","Practical (PRA)","Physics (A); Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods, robots can build maps of the environment which are efficient for localization and path planning as long as the environment remains unchanged. However, facility logistics environments are not static because pallets and other obstacles are stored temporarily. This paper proposes a novel solution for updating maps of changing environments (i.e. environments with low-dynamic or semi-static objects) in real-time with multiple robots. Each robot is equipped with a laser range sensor and runs localization to estimate its position. Each robot senses the change in the environment with respect to a current map, initially built with a SLAM method, and constructs a temporary map which will be merged into the current map using localization information and line features of the map. This procedure enables the creation of long-term mapping robot systems for facility logistics.","31","cartography - estimation theory - laser ranging - logistics - multi-robot systems - path planning - sensors - SLAM (robots)","dynamic map update - nonstatic facility logistics environment - mult-robot system - autonomous robots - simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM methods - map building - path planning - facility logistics environments - multiple robots - laser range sensor - position estimation - long-term mapping robot systems","C3390 Robotics - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C3/00 - G01S17/00 - G05D3/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

From this noisy sensor data, the robot must build a representation of the environment and localize itself within this representation. This process, known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), is a prerequisite for almost all higher-level autonomous behavior in mobile robotics. By associating the robot's sensory observations as it moves through the environment, and by observing the robot's ego-motion through proprioceptive sensors, constraints are placed on the trajectory of the robot and the configuration of the environment. This results in a probabilistic optimization problem to find the most likely robot trajectory and environment configuration given all of the robot's previous sensory experience. SLAM has been well studied under the assumptions that the robot operates for a relatively short time period and that the environment is essentially static during operation. However, performing SLAM over long time periods while modeling the dynamic changes in the environment remains a challenge. The goal of this thesis is to extend the capabilities of SLAM to enable long-term autonomous operation in dynamic environments. The contribution of this thesis has three main components: First, we propose a framework for controlling the computational complexity of the SLAM optimization problem so that it does not grow unbounded with exploration time. Second, we present a method to learn visual feature descriptors that are more robust to changes in lighting, allowing for improved data association in dynamic environments. Finally, we use the proposed tools in SLAM systems that explicitly models the dynamics of the environment in the map by representing each location as a set of example views that capture how the location changes with time. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed methods enable long-term SLAM in dynamic environments using a large, realworld vision and LIDAR dataset collected over the course of more than a year. This dataset captures a wide variety of dynamics: from short-term scene changes including moving people, cars, changing lighting, and weather conditions; to long-term dynamics including seasonal conditions and structural changes caused by construction.","0","mobile robots - optical radar - sensor fusion","autonomous mobile robotics - LIDAR dataset - real-world vision - data association - visual feature descriptors - computational complexity - long-term autonomous operation - dynamic environments - long-term simultaneous localization and mapping","B7230 Sensing devices and transducers - B6140 Signal processing and detection - B6320C Optical radar - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260A Sensor fusion","G01S17/00 - G05D1/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

To deal with these problems, an AUV robust BSLAM algorithm is proposed based on graph SLAM. In this algorithm, weak data association is constructed via sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) regression to predict inter-frame motion, and a multi-window consistency method (MCM) is introduced to identify invalid loop closures. Various simulation experiments are conducted under different environments. Comparisons are made between more standard approaches, and our proposed algorithm is shown to be viable, accurate, and could robustly handle invalid loop closures.

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and visual odometry/SLAM are popular methods for state estimation. However, when working between tall buildings or in indoor environments, GNSS fails due to limited sky view or obstruction from buildings. Visual odometry/SLAM are prone to long-term drifting in the absence of reliable loop closure detection. A state estimation method with global-consistent guarantee is desirable for navigation applications. As for real-time mapping, SLAM methods usually get a sparse map that is not good enough for obstacle avoidance and path-planning, and high-quality dense mapping is often computationally too demanding for mobile devices. Realizing the availability of city-scale 3D models, in this work, we improve our previous work on model-based global localization, and propose a model-aided monocular visual-inertial state estimation and dense mapping solution. We first develop a global-consistent state estimator by fusing visual-inertial odometry with the model-based localization results. Utilizing depth prior from the model, we perform motion stereo with semi-global disparity smoothing.

While occupancy-grid and landmark-based maps have been successfully employed by the robotics community in indoor scenarios, outdoor long-term autonomous operations require a more compact representation of the environment. This work tackles this problem by interpolating the data of a high frequency sensor using B-spline curves. Compared to lines and circles, splines are more powerful in the sense that they allow for the description of more complex shapes in the scene. In this work, spline curves are continuously tracked and aligned across multiple sensor readings using lightweight methods, making the proposed framework suitable for robot navigation in outdoor missions. In particular, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm specifically tailored for B-spline maps is presented here.

While most previously reported methods are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images, our approach uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach, T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then decodes the resulting predictions. On deployment, the approach can perform on-the-fly prediction in real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15 km of pedestrian trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months.

In this paper, we introduce a topological local-metric framework (TLF), aiming at dealing with environmental changes, erroneous measurements and achieving constant complexity. TLF organizes the sensor data collected by the robot in a topological graph, of which the geometry is only encoded in the edge, i.e. the relative poses between adjacent nodes, relaxing the global consistency to local consistency. Therefore the TLF is more robust to unavoidable erroneous measurements from sensor information matching since the error is constrained in the local. Based on TLF, as there is no global coordinate, we further propose the localization and navigation algorithms by switching across multiple local metric coordinates. Besides, a lifelong memorizing mechanism is presented to memorize the environmental changes in the TLF with constant complexity, as no global optimization is required. In experiments, the framework and algorithms are evaluated on 21-session data collected by stereo cameras, which are sensitive to illumination, and compared with the state-of-art global consistent framework. The results demonstrate that TLF can achieve similar localization accuracy with that from global consistent framework, but brings higher robustness with lower cost. The localization performance can also be improved from sessions because of the memorizing mechanism. Finally, equipped with TLF, the robot navigates itself in a 1 km session autonomously.","51","graph theory - mobile robots - navigation - path planning","global consistent framework - topological local-metric framework - TLF - constant complexity - sensor data - stability - robustness - world application deployment - long term perspective - mobile robots navigation - local-metric framework - localization performance - similar localization accuracy - global optimization - environmental changes - multiple local metric coordinates - navigation algorithms - sensor information matching - unavoidable erroneous measurements - local consistency - global consistency - topological graph - size 1.0 km","C3390C Mobile robots - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3120C Spatial variables control","G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In these areas, INS-based Dead Reckoning (DR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies are normally used to estimate positions as separate tools. However, there are critical implementation problems with each standalone system. The drift errors of velocity, position, and heading angles in an INS will accumulate over time, and on-line calibration is a must for sustaining positioning accuracy. SLAM performance is poor in featureless environments where the matching errors can significantly increase. Each standalone positioning method cannot offer a sustainable navigation solution with acceptable accuracy. This paper integrates two complementary technologies-INS and LiDAR SLAM-into one navigation frame with a loosely coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to use the advantages and overcome the drawbacks of each system to establish a stable long-term navigation process. Static and dynamic field tests were carried out with a self-developed Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform-NAVIS. The results prove that the proposed approach can provide positioning accuracy at the centimetre level for long-term operations, even in a featureless indoor environment.","31","calibration - inertial navigation - Kalman filters - nonlinear filters - optical radar - position control - remotely operated vehicles - satellite navigation - SLAM (robots)","LiDAR scan matching aided inertial navigation system - INS - GNSS-degraded environment - GNSS-denied environment - DR - dead reckoning - simultaneous localization and mapping technology - SLAM technology - position estimation - calibration - loosely coupled extended Kalman filter - EKF - unmanned ground vehicle - UGV - NAVIS","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B6320C Optical radar - B7130 Measurement standards and calibration - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3390T Telerobotics","G01D18/00 - G01P7/00 - G01S - G01S5/02 - G01S17/00 - G05D3/00 - G12B13/00 - G01C21/16 - G01S19/01","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The long-term unreliable keyframe linking with large uncertainty of GPS which called GPS-restricted or GPS-denied situation will cause the drift when mapping. To eliminate the drift, in contrast to use the closed-loop detection and global optimization which will increase the computational burden extremely with the size of the map enlarged, a semi-global optimization method is proposed to relieve the burden, which make the localization estimated by this method possible to be used to navigate for unmanned vehicles. In our method, the confidence of the GPS signal is significantly important, however, the covariance supplied by the GPS receiver may not be trustworthy sometimes, which cause some unnecessary mistake when optimizing, thus a semi-supervised clustering method taking the information of GPS and IMU into account synthetically is introduced to get that confidence more robustly.","12","distance measurement - Global Positioning System - mobile robots - path planning - pattern clustering - SLAM (robots)","GPS signal - window size - local mapping thread - GPS-denied situation - closed-loop detection - global optimization - semiglobal optimization method - GPS receiver - semisupervised clustering method - IMU - real-time visual-inertial mapping - localization method - unstable GPS - high-precision real-time localization - bundle adjustment - GPS-restricted situation","B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C3390C Mobile robots","G01B - G01S - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095 - G01S19/01","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

However, the PCD map structure, widely used in robot fields, has some problems to be applied for mass production in automotive fields. First, the PCD map is too big to store all map data at in-vehicle units or download the map data from a wireless network according to the vehicle location. Second, the PCD map, represented by a single origin in the Cartesian coordinates, causes coordinate conversion errors due to an inaccurate plane-orb projection, when the vehicle estimate the geodetic pose on Earth. To solve two problems, this paper presents a geodetic normal distribution (GND) map structure. The GND map structure supports a geodetic quad-tree tiling system with multiple origins to minimize the coordinate conversion errors. The map data managed by the GND map structure are compressed by using Cartesian probabilistic distributions of points as map features. The truncation errors by heterogeneous coordinates between the geodetic tiling system and Cartesian distributions are compensated by the Cartesian voxelization rule.

For fully autonomous systems, the robot would further need to actively plan its paths during exploration. The problem of designing robot trajectories to actively explore an unknown environment and minimize the map error is referred to as active simultaneous localization and mapping (active SLAM). Existing work has focused on planning paths with occupancy grid maps, which do not scale well and suffer from long term drift. This work proposes a Topological Feature Graph (TFG) representation that scales well and develops an active SLAM algorithm with it. The TFG uses graphical models, which utilize independences between variables, and enables a unified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single entropy metric. Hence, it facilitates a natural and principled balance between map exploration and refinement. A probabilistic roadmap path-planner is used to generate robot paths in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than a standard grid-map based approach while requiring orders of magnitude less computation and memory resources.","25","entropy - graph theory - mobile robots - path planning - probability - SLAM (robots) - trajectory control","information-based active SLAM - mobile robots - fully autonomous systems - path planning - robot trajectories - occupancy grid maps - topological feature graph representation - TFG representation - entropy metric - probabilistic roadmap path-planner - robot path generation - standard grid-map based approach - magnitude less computation - memory resources - active simultaneous localization and mapping","C3390C Mobile robots - C1140Z Other topics in statistics - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Most state-of-the-art localization approaches assume static scenes, so maps are often reconstructed once and then kept constant. However, many scenes are dynamic and as changes in the scene happen, future localization attempts may struggle or fail entirely. Therefore, it is important for successful long-term localization to update and maintain maps as new observations of the scene, and changes in it, arrive. We propose a novel method for automatically discovering which points in a map remain stable over time, and which are due to transient changes. To this end, we calculate a stability store for each point based on its visibility over time, weighted by an exponential decay over time. This allows us to consider the impact of time when scoring points, and to distinguish which points are useful for long-term localization. We evaluate our method on the CMU Extended Seasons dataset (outdoors) and a new indoor dataset of a retail shop, and show the benefit of maintaining a `live map' that integrates updates over time using our exponential decay based method over a static `base map'.","51","cameras - geophysical image processing - indoor radio - mobile computing - mobile robots - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - terrain mapping","static scenes - long-term localization - live map - exponential decay based method - static base map - dynamic scenes - visual camera localization - offline maps - CMU Extended Seasons dataset","A9385 Instrumentation and techniques for geophysical, hydrospheric and lower atmosphere research - A9365 Data and information; acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination in geophysics - B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B7710 Geophysical techniques and equipment - B7730 Other topics in Earth sciences - C7340 Geophysics computing - C7840 Geography and cartography computing - C6190V Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01V - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06F9/44 - G06T","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Physics (A); Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Recently, several approaches using landmark information to represent a place showed promising performance to address long-term environment changes. However, previous approaches do not explicitly consider changes of the landmarks, i,e., old landmarks may disappear and new ones often appear over time. In addition, representations used in these approaches to represent landmarks are limited, based upon visual or spatial cues only. In this paper, we introduce a novel worst-case graph matching approach that integrates spatial relationships of landmarks with their appearances for long-term place recognition. Our method designs a graph representation to encode distance and angular spatial relationships as well as visual appearances of landmarks in order to represent a place. Then, we formulate place recognition as a graph matching problem under the worst-case scenario. Our approach matches places by computing the similarities of distance and angular spatial relationships of the landmarks that have the least similar appearances (i.e., worst-case). If the worst appearance similarity of landmarks is small, two places are identified to be not the same, even though their graph representations have high spatial relationship similarities. We evaluate our approach over two public benchmark datasets for long-term place recognition, including St. Lucia and CMU-VL. The experimental results have validated that our approach obtains the state-of-the-art place recognition performance, with a changing number of landmarks.","48","graph theory - image matching - mobile robots - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","robotics applications - simultaneously localization and mapping - spatial relationship similarities - spatial cues - visual cues - old landmarks - long-term environment changes - landmark information - integrate landmark appearances - worst-case graph matching - place recognition performance - long-term place recognition - worst appearance similarity - similar appearances - worst-case scenario - graph matching problem - visual appearances - angular spatial relationships - graph representation","B6135E Image recognition - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Modern sensors (such as Kinect) tend to produce a lot of data. However, long-term autonomy requires us to store this information in a succinct manner. One way to reduce dimensionality of information is to attribute semantics. Most indoor objects are cuboidal in nature. We conjecture that cuboids are a suitable semantic feature to attribute to indoor objects for efficient mapping. We adapt a cuboid fitting algorithm previously proposedfor object recognition, for indoor mapping. Our work stems from the observation that landmark detection for mappingrequires consistent detection of those landmarks. We implement several modifications to this cuboid detection algorithm that lead to consistent detection such as emptiness, orientation, surface coverage, distance from edges, and others. We incorporate these in the identification of the cuboid candidates in a scene, as well as an optimization algorithm for finding the best set of consistent cubes to cover a given scene. Our experiments show that in comparison, the set of cuboids detected by our algorithm are at least 50% more consistent based on our metrics.SLAM.","15","object recognition - optimisation - SLAM (robots)","semantic mapping - cuboid fitting algorithm - landmark detection - cuboid detection algorithm - optimization algorithm - SLAM","B6135E Image recognition - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Methods for joint localization and mapping constitute the basis for (semi-)autonomous cooperative action, in particular when navigating in GPS-denied areas. As communication losses may occur, a decentralized solution is required. With these challenges in mind, we designed a submap-based SLAM system that relies on inertial measurements and stereo-vision to create multi-robot dense 3D maps. For online pose and map estimation, we integrate the results of keyframe-based local reference filters through incremental graph SLAM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine these two methods to benefit from their particular advantages for 6D multi-robot localization and mapping: Local reference filters on each robot provide real-time, long-term stable state estimates that are required for stabilization, control and fast obstacle avoidance, whereas online graph optimization provides global multi-robot pose and map estimates needed for cooperative planning. We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios. Further, we performed two extended experiments in a multi-robot setup to evaluate the full SLAM system, including visual robot detections and submap matches as inter-robot loop closure constraints.","24","collision avoidance - graph theory - image filtering - multi-robot systems - optimisation - pose estimation - rescue robots - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - stereo image processing","SLAM graph - visual robot detections - interrobot loop closure constraints - local filter - decoupled integration - graph topology - cooperative planning - global multirobot pose estimation - online graph optimization - obstacle avoidance - 6D multirobot localization and mapping - incremental graph SLAM - keyframe-based local reference filters - map estimation - online pose estimation - multirobot dense 3D maps - stereo-vision - inertial measurements - submap-based SLAM system - decentralized solution - semiautonomous cooperative action - joint mapping - joint localization - search and rescue missions - mobile robot teams - decoupled local reference filters - multirobot 6D graph SLAM","B6135E Image recognition - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics","B60W30/08 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - G08G - H04N13/00","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In this scenario, the navigation system needs to continuously update and refine its feature map in order to adapt to the environment appearance change. To achieve reliable long-term navigation, the map management techniques have to (i) select features useful for the current navigation task, (ii) remove features that are obsolete, (iii) and add new features from the current camera view to the map. We propose several map management strategies and evaluate their performance with regard to the robot localisation accuracy in long-term teach-and-repeat navigation. Our experiments, performed over three months, indicate that strategies which model cyclic changes of the environment appearance and predict which features are going to be visible at a particular time and location, outperform strategies which do not explicitly model the temporal evolution of the changes.","38","cameras - feature selection - mobile robots - navigation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","predictive maps - adaptive maps - long-term visual navigation - navigation system - feature map - environment appearance change - long-term navigation - map management strategies - teach- repeat navigation - model cyclic changes - long-term teach-and-repeat navigation - feature selection","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G01C21/00 - G03B17/00 - G03B19/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2020, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

It uses a optical flow camera pointing downwards, a IMU and a monocular camera pointing frontwards. That configuration avoids the computational expensive mapping and tracking of the 3D features. It only maps these features in a vocabulary list by a localization module to tackle the optical flow drift and the lose of the navigation estimation. That module, based on the well established algorithm DBoW2, will be also used to close the loop and allow long-term navigation in previously visited areas. The combination of high speed optical flow navigation with a low rate localization algorithm allows fully autonomous navigation for MAV, at the same time it reduces the overall computational load.

There have been numerous approaches for solving simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in office (or room) and hallway. However, direct application of the existing approaches to wide-open space may be failed, because it has some distinguished features compared to other indoor places. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new ceiling vision-based active SLAM framework, with an emphasis on practical deployment of service robot for commercial use in dynamically changing and wide-open environments by adopting the ceiling vision. First, for defining ceiling feature which can be extracted regardless of complexity of ceiling pattern we introduce a model-free landmark, i.e., visual node descriptor, which consists of edge points and their orientations in image space. Second, a recursive `explore and exploit' is proposed for autonomous mapping. It is recursively performed by spreading out mapped area gradually while the robot is actively localized in the map. It can improve map accuracy due to frequent small loop closing. Third, a dynamic edge link (DEL) is proposed to cope with environmental changes in the map. Owing to DEL, we do not need to filter out corrupted sensor data and to distinguish moving object from static one. Also, a self-repairing map mechanism is introduced to deal with unexpected installation or removal of inner structures. We therefore achieve long-term navigation. Several simulations and real experiments in various places show that the proposed active SLAM framework could build a topologically consistent map, and demonstrated that it can be applied well to real environments such as wide-open space in a city hall and railway station.","58","mobile robots - navigation - robot vision - service robots - SLAM (robots)","long-term navigation - DEL - dynamic edge link - image space - visual node descriptor - model-free landmark - service robot - simultaneous localization and mapping - indoor environment - wide-open environments - dynamic environments - ceiling vision-based active SLAM framework","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques","G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T","Bibliography (BIB); Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases.

In contrast to odometry drift in the long-term, our method using only odometry and the map converges in long-term. Our method can also be integrated with other sensors to boost the localization performance. The algorithm does not have any initial state assumption and tracks all possible robot states at all times. Therefore, our method is global and is robust in the event of ambiguous observations. We parallel each step of our algorithm such that it can be performed in real-time (up to ~300 Hz) using GPU.

With a 3D LiDAR sensor, highly accurate localization becomes possible, which enables high quality 3D reconstruction of the environment. In this letter we extend the well-known LOAM framework by leveraging prior knowledge about a reference object in the environment to further improve the localization accuracy. This requires a known 3D model of the reference object and its known position in a global coordinate frame. Instead of only relying on the point features in the mapping module of LOAM, we also include mesh features extracted from the 3D triangular mesh of the reference object in the optimization problem. For fast correspondence computation of mesh features, we use the Axis-Aligned-Bounding-Box-Tree (AABB) structure. Essentially, our approach not only makes use of the previously built map for absolute localization in the environment, but also takes the relative position to the reference object into account, effectively reducing long-term drift. To validate the proposed concept, we generated datasets using the Gazebo simulation environment in exemplary visual inspection scenarios of an airplane inside a hangar and the Eiffel Tower. An actuated 3D LiDAR sensor is mounted via a 1-DoF gimbal on a UAV capturing 360° scans. We benchmark our approach against the state-of-the-art open-source LOAM framework. The results show that the proposed joint optimization using both point and mesh features yields a significant reduction in Absolute Pose Error (APE) and therefore improves the map and 3D reconstruction quality during long-term operations.","29","autonomous aerial vehicles - distance measurement - feature extraction - Global Positioning System - image reconstruction - mesh generation - mobile robots - optical radar - pose estimation - position control - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - solid modelling - stereo image processing - trees (mathematics)","high quality 3D reconstruction - 3D model - 3D triangular mesh - Gazebo simulation environment - actuated 3D LiDAR sensor - point-to-mesh features - robot position - R-LOAM - LiDAR odometry and mapping - 3D reference object - axis-aligned-bounding-box-tree structure - open-source LOAM - AABB structure - mesh feature extraction - UAV 360° scan capturing - absolute pose error - GPS","B6135E Image recognition - B6320C Optical radar - B6330 Radionavigation and direction finding - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0290T Finite element analysis - B7320C Spatial variables measurement - C3360L Aerospace control - C3390C Mobile robots - C3390T Telerobotics - C4185 Finite element analysis - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6130B Graphics techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics","G01B - G01S - G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - H04N13/00 - G01S19/01","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2021, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The ability to exchange map information is an essential requirement for collaborative exploration. When moving to large-scale environments, where the communication data rate between the swarm participants is typically limited, efficient compression algorithms and an approach for discarding less informative parts of the map are key for a successful long-term operation. In this paper, we present a novel compression approach for environment maps obtained from a visual SLAM system. We apply feature coding to the visual information to compress the map efficiently. We make use of a minimum spanning tree to connect all features that serve as observations of a single map point. Thereby, we can exploit inter-feature dependencies and obtain an optimal coding order. Additionally, we add a map sparsification step to keep only useful map points by solving a linear integer programming problem, which preserves the map points that exhibit both good compression properties and high observability. We evaluate the proposed method on a standard dataset and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.","28","data compression - image coding - integer programming - linear programming - mobile robots - multi-robot systems - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - trees (mathematics)","swarm robotics - map information - collaborative exploration - communication data rate - swarm participants - environment maps - visual SLAM system - visual information - minimum spanning tree - single map point - inter-feature dependencies - optimal coding order - map sparsification step - map compression - collaborative visual SLAM - linear integer programming problem","B6135C Image and video coding - B0250 Combinatorial mathematics - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1160 Combinatorial mathematics - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G05D1/00 - G06T - G06T9/00 - H03M7/30","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

This is necessary for optimal path planning and safe navigation. To accomplish this over an extended period of time, the global map requires long term maintenance. This includes the addition of newly observable features and the removal of transient features belonging to dynamic objects. The latter is especially important for the long-term use of the map as matching against a map with features that no longer exist can result in incorrect data associations, and consequently erroneous localisation. This paper addresses the problem of removing features from the map that correspond to objects that are no longer observable/present in the environment. This is achieved by assigning a single score which depends on the geometric distribution and characteristics when the features are re-detected (or not) on different occasions. Our approach not only eliminates ephemeral features, but can also be used as a reduction algorithm for highly dense maps. We tested our approach using half a year of weekly drives over the same 500 metre section of road in an urban environment. The results presented demonstrate the validity of the long term approach to map maintenance.","22","feature extraction - geometry - mobile robots - object detection - optimisation - path planning - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","feature-based maps - urban environment - automated vehicle - global map reference frame - optimal path planning - safe navigation - dynamic objects - geometric distribution - map maintenance - landmarks identification - autonomous vehicle","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B0260 Optimisation techniques - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C3120C Spatial variables control","G05D1/00 - G05D3/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In office indoors the comparable accuracy is 50 cm but is more sensitive to changes in the environment.",,"feature extraction - image classification - image matching - image recognition - image retrieval - object recognition - optical radar - remote sensing by laser beam - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - visual databases","long-term LiDAR place recognition - state-of-the-art deep image retrieval - deep place recognition method - LiDAR data - place recognition aims - visited locations - experimental comparisons - challenging outdoor datasets - indoor datasets - Oxford Radar RobotCar - gallery data - image retrieval methods - LiDAR depth images - size 5.0 m - size 50.0 cm","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - B6135E Image recognition - B6320C Optical radar - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6160S Spatial and pictorial databases - C7250R Information retrieval techniques - C1140Z Other topics in statistics","G01S17/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T - G06F16/00","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2022, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In particular it examines ways in which vehicles, considered as independent agents, can share, update and leverage each others' visual experiences in a mutually beneficial way. We draw on our previous work in Experience-based Navigation (EBN) [1], in which a visual map supporting multiple representations of the same place is built, yielding real-time localisation capability for a solitary vehicle. We now consider how any number of such agents might operate in concert via data sharing policies that are germane to the shared task of lifelong localisation. We rapidly construct considerable maps by the conjoining of work distributed to asynchronous processes, and share expertise amongst the team by the selective dispensing of mission-specific map contents. We demonstrate and evaluate our system against 100km of data collected in North Oxford over a period of a month featuring diverse deviation in appearance due to atmospheric, lighting, and structural dynamics. We show that our framework is capable of creating maps in a fraction of the time required by single-agent EBN, with no significant loss in localisation robustness, and is able to furnish robots on real-world forays with maps which require much less storage.","23","configuration management - mobile robots - navigation - robot dynamics - robot vision - SLAM (robots) - vehicle dynamics","robots - autonomous vehicle fleets - structural dynamics - visual map supporting - EBN - experience-based navigation - visual localisation - version control","B6135 Optical, image and video signal processing - C3360 Transportation system control - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C6110B Software engineering techniques - E2220 Vehicle mechanics - E2230 Robot and manipulator mechanics","G01C21/00 - G05D1/00 - G06F9/44 - G06T","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C); Manufacturing and production engineering (E)","Inspec","Copyright 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

The proposed method presents a robust year-round localization performance even when learned in just a single day. The proposed localizer learns a point cloud descriptor, named Scan Context Image (SCI), and performs robot localization on a grid map by formulating the place recognition problem as place classification using a convolutional neural network. Our method is faster than existing methods proposed for place recognition because it avoids a pairwise comparison between a query and scans in a database. In addition, we provide thorough validations using publicly available long-term datasets, the NCLT dataset and the Oxford RobotCar dataset, and show that the Scan Context Image (SCI) localization attains consistent performance over a year and outperforms existing methods.","23","image classification - learning (artificial intelligence) - mobile robots - neural nets - optical radar - path planning - robot vision","long-term LiDAR localization - long-term localization method - structural information - image format - point cloud descriptor - place recognition problem - place classification - convolutional neural network - robot localization - grid map - Oxford RobotCar dataset - scan context image localization - time 1 year - time 1 d","B6320C Optical radar - B6135E Image recognition - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C5290 Neural computing techniques - C3390C Mobile robots","G01S17/00 - G05D1/00 - G06T - B60W30/095","Practical (PRA)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

In FastSLAM, particle filter is used for the robot pose (position and orientation) estimation, and parametric filter (i.e. EKF and UKF) is used for the feature location's estimation. However, in the long term, FastSLAM is an inconsistent algorithm. In this paper, a new approach to SLAM based on hybrid auxiliary marginalised particle filter and differential evolution (DE) is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the robot pose is estimated based on auxiliary marginal particle filter that operates directly on the marginal distribution, and hence avoids performing importance sampling on a space of growing dimension. In addition, static map is considered as a set of parameters that are learned using DE. Compared to other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can improve consistency for longer time periods and also, improve the estimation accuracy. Simulations and experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective.","29","evolutionary computation - Kalman filters - mobile robots - nonlinear filters - particle filtering (numerical methods) - pose estimation - robot vision - SLAM (robots)","simultaneous localisation-and-mapping - hybrid auxiliary marginalised particle filter - differential evolution - Rao-Blackwellised particle filter - robot pose estimation - position estimation - orientation estimation - parametric filter - EKF - UKF - feature location estimation - marginal distribution - static map - FastSLAM","B6135E Image recognition - B6140B Filtering methods in signal processing - B0260 Optimisation techniques - B0240G Monte Carlo methods - C3390C Mobile robots - C5260B Computer vision and image processing techniques - C1180 Optimisation techniques - C1140G Monte Carlo methods","G05D1/00 - G06K9/00 - G06T","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Electrical/Electronic engineering (B); Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2015, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"

Mobile robots face unique challenges when operating in environments that change over time, where systems must maintain an accurate representation of the environment with respect to both spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper describes a spatio-temporal technique for extending the autonomy of a mobile robot in a changing environment. This new technique called Obstacle Persistent Adaptive Map Maintenance (OPAMM) uses navigation data collected during normal operations to perform periodic self-maintenance of its environment model. OPAMM implements a probabilistic feature persistence model to predict the survival state of obstacles and update the world model. Maintaining an accurate world model is necessary for extending the long-term autonomy of robots in realistic scenarios. Results show that robots using OPAMM had localizations scores higher than other methods, thus reducing long-term localization degradation.","28","mobile robots - temporal reasoning","changing environment - OPAMM - periodic self-maintenance - environment model - probabilistic feature persistence model - autonomous mobile robots - spatio-temporal reasoning - mobile robotic systems - autonomous tasks - spatial dimensions - temporal dimensions - spatio-temporal technique - obstacle persistent adaptive map maintenance - long-term localization degradation","C3390C Mobile robots - C6170K Knowledge engineering techniques","G05D1/00 - G06F15/18 - G06N5/04","Practical (PRA); Theoretical or Mathematical (THR)","Computers/Control engineering (C)","Inspec","Copyright 2019, The Institution of Engineering and Technology","Engineering Village"
