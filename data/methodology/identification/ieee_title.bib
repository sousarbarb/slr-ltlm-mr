abstract={This paper presents a new approach for topological localisation of service robots in dynamic indoor environments. In contrast to typical localisation approaches that rely mainly on static parts of the environment, our approach makes explicit use of information about changes by learning and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment where the robot is acting. The proposed spatio-temporal world model is able to predict environmental changes in time, allowing the robot to improve its localisation capabilities during long-term operations in populated environments. To investigate the proposed approach, we have enabled a mobile robot to autonomously patrol a populated environment over a period of one week while building the proposed model representation. We demonstrate that the experience learned during one week is applicable for topological localization even after a hiatus of three months by showing that the localization error rate is significantly lower compared to static environment representations.},

abstract={This work considers a mobile service robot which uses an appearance-based representation of its workplace as a map, where the current view and the map are used to estimate the current position in the environment. Due to the nature of real-world environments such as houses and offices, where the appearance keeps changing, the internal representation may become out of date after some time. To solve this problem the robot needs to be able to adapt its internal representation continually to the changes in the environment. This paper presents a method for creating an adaptive map for long-term appearance-based localization of a mobile robot using long-term and short-term memory concepts, with omni-directional vision as the external sensor.},

abstract={Localization on 3D data is a challenging task for unmanned vehicles, especially in long-term dynamic urban scenarios. Due to the generality and long-term stability, the pole-like objects are very suitable as landmarks for unmanned vehicle localization in time-varying scenarios. In this paper, a long-term LiDAR-only localization algorithm based on semantic cluster map is proposed. At first, the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used to infer the semantics of LiDAR point clouds. Combined with the point cloud segmentation, the static objects pole/trunk are extracted and registered into global semantic cluster map. When the unmanned vehicle re-enters the environment again, the relocalization is completed by matching the clusters of current scan with the clusters of the global map. Furthermore, the matching between the local and global maps stably outputs the global pose at 2Hz to correct the drift of the 3D LiDAR odometry. The experimental results on our campus dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in localization accuracy compared with the current state-of-the-art methods.

abstract={In many applications of mobile robot, the environment is constantly changing. How to use historical information to analysis environmental changes and generate a map corresponding with current environment is important to achieve high-precision localization. Inspired by predictive mechanism of brain, this paper presents a long-term localization approach named ArmMPU (ARMA-based Map Prediction and Update) based on time series modeling and prediction. Autoregressive moving average model (ARMA), a kind of time series modeling method, is employed for environmental map modeling and prediction, then predicted map and filtered observation are fused to fix the prediction error. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method improves long-term localization performance in dynamic environments.},

abstract={Service robots should be able to operate autonomously in dynamic and daily changing environments over an extended period of time. While Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most fundamental problems for robotic autonomy, most existing SLAM works are evaluated with data sequences that are recorded in a short period of time. In real-world deployment, there can be out-of-sight scene changes caused by both natural factors and human activities. For example, in home scenarios, most objects may be movable, replaceable or deformable, and the visual features of the same place may be significantly different in some successive days. Such out-of-sight dynamics pose great challenges to the robustness of pose estimation, and hence a robot’s long-term deployment and operation. To differentiate the forementioned problem from the conventional works which are usually evaluated in a static setting in a single run, the term lifelong SLAM is used here to address SLAM problems in an ever-changing environment over a long period of time. To accelerate lifelong SLAM research, we release the OpenLORIS-Scene datasets. The data are collected in real-world indoor scenes, for multiple times in each place to include scene changes in real life. We also design benchmarking metrics for lifelong SLAM, with which the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation are evaluated separately. The datasets and benchmark are available online at lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/scene.},
