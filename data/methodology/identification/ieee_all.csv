,Vision-Aided Multi-UAV Autonomous Flocking in GPS-Denied Environment,Y. Tang and Y. Hu and J. Cui and F. Liao and M. Lao and F. Lin and R. S. H. Teo,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,616--626,66,"This paper presents a sophisticated vision-aided flocking system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is able to operate in GPS-denied unknown environments for exploring and searching missions, and also able to adopt two types of vision sensors, day and thermal cameras, to measure relative motion between UAVs in different lighting conditions without using wireless communication. In order to realize robust vision-aided flocking, an integrated framework of tracking-learning-detection on the basis of multifeature coded correlation filter has been developed. To achieve long-term tracking, a redetector is trained online to adaptively reinitialize target for global sensing. An advanced flocking strategy is developed to address the autonomous multi-UAVs' cooperative flight. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based navigation modules are developed for autonomous localization, mapping, and obstacle avoidance. Flight experiments of a team of UAVs have been conducted to verify the performance of this flocking system in a GPS-denied environment. The extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed vision algorithms in challenging scenarios.",,10.1109/TIE.2018.2824766,,,,Target tracking;Sensors;Cameras;Correlation;Trajectory;Robustness;Visualization;Flocking;unmanned system;visual sensing,,1557-9948,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Duckett,,2016,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,4558--4563,,"We present a lifelong mapping and localisation system for long-term autonomous operation of mobile robots in changing environments. The core of the system is a spatio-temporal occupancy grid that explicitly represents the persistence and periodicity of the individual cells and can predict the probability of their occupancy in the future. During navigation, our robot builds temporally local maps and integrates then into the global spatio-temporal grid. Through re-observation of the same locations, the spatio-temporal grid learns the long-term environment dynamics and gains the ability to predict the future environment states. This predictive ability allows to generate time-specific 2d maps used by the robot's localisation and planning modules. By analysing data from a long-term deployment of the robot in a human-populated environment, we show that the proposed representation improves localisation accuracy and the efficiency of path planning. We also show how to integrate the method into the ROS navigation stack for use by other roboticists.",,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759671,,,,Navigation;Two dimensional displays;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Predictive models;Robot kinematics;mobile robotics;long-term autonomy,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Hagita,,2015,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,5748--5754,,"This paper presents a work on mapping the use of space by humans in long periods of time. Daily geometric maps with the same coordinate frame were generated with SLAM, and in a similar manner, daily affordance density maps (places people use) were generated with the output of a human tracker running on the robot. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: an approach to detect geometric changes to cluster them in similar geometric configurations and the building of geometric and affordance composite maps on each cluster. This approach avoids the loss of long term retrieved information. Geometric similarity was computed using a normal distance approach on the maps. The analysis was performed on data collected by a mobile robot for a period of 4 months accumulating data equivalent to 70 days. Experimental results show that the system is capable of detecting geometric changes in the environment and clustering similar geometric configurations.",,10.1109/IROS.2015.7354193,,,,Robot kinematics;Buildings;Navigation;Robot sensing systems;Layout;Geometry,,,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,
,Research of large-scale offline map management in visual SLAM,Q. Shen and H. Sun and P. Ye,,2017,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,215--219,,"This paper presents a novel method of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which is a method of real-time localization and mapping. It is important for a mobile robot to build a map while autonomously navigation. Due to the complexity of the robot work scene, the SLAM method proposed in this paper optimizes map management. It will cost a lot of time and space when a robot long-term works in a same large scene. Therefore, we propose a method in this paper to save a detail map as an offline map in advance. At the same time in order to facilitate the follow-up optimization, the offline map can be divided into several sub-graphs according to the similarity of the scene. Since the segmented offline map has been saved to local system, it can be loaded at any time to localization and obtain the pose of current frame.",,10.1109/ICSAI.2017.8248292,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Image segmentation;Cameras;Real-time systems;Optimization;Symmetric matrices;SLAM;offline map;segment graph;normalized-cut,,,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,
,Long-term Place Recognition through Worst-case Graph Matching to Integrate Landmark Appearances and Spatial Relationships,P. Gao and H. Zhang,,2020,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,1070--1076,,"Place recognition is an important component for simultaneously localization and mapping in a variety of robotics applications. Recently, several approaches using landmark information to represent a place showed promising performance to address long-term environment changes. However, previous approaches do not explicitly consider changes of the landmarks, i,e., old landmarks may disappear and new ones often appear over time. In addition, representations used in these approaches to represent landmarks are limited, based upon visual or spatial cues only. In this paper, we introduce a novel worst-case graph matching approach that integrates spatial relationships of landmarks with their appearances for long-term place recognition. Our method designs a graph representation to encode distance and angular spatial relationships as well as visual appearances of landmarks in order to represent a place. Then, we formulate place recognition as a graph matching problem under the worst-case scenario. Our approach matches places by computing the similarities of distance and angular spatial relationships of the landmarks that have the least similar appearances (i.e., worst-case). If the worst appearance similarity of landmarks is small, two places are identified to be not the same, even though their graph representations have high spatial relationship similarities. We evaluate our approach over two public benchmark datasets for long-term place recognition, including St. Lucia and CMU-VL. The experimental results have validated that our approach obtains the state-of-the-art place recognition performance, with a changing number of landmarks.",,10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196906,,,,Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Robustness;Strain;Image recognition;Tensile stress,,2577-087X,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Dubé,,2018,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,3430--3437,,"Reliable long-term localization is key for robotic systems in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for long-term localization using 3D LiDARs, coined PoseMap. In essence, we extract distinctive features from range measurements and bundle these into local views along with observation poses. The sensor's trajectory is then estimated in a sliding window fashion by matching current and old features and minimizing the distances in-between. The map representation facilitates finding a suitable set of old features, by selecting the closest local map(s) for matching. Similarly to a visibility analysis, this procedure provides a suitable set of features for localization but at a fraction of the computational cost. PoseMap also allows for updates and extensions of the map at any time by replacing and adding local maps when necessary. We evaluate our approach using two platforms both equipped with a 3D LiDAR and an IMU, demonstrating localization at 8 Hz and robustness to changes in the environment such as moving vehicles and changing vegetation. PoseMap was implemented on an autonomous vehicle allowing it to drive autonomously over a period of 18 months through a mix of industrial and unstructured off-road environments, covering more than 100 kms without a single localization failure.",,10.1109/IROS.2018.8593854,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Optimization;Feature extraction,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62201,44698.62201,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Hoppenot,,2011,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,186--191,,"One aim of ambient assistive technologies is to reduce long term hospitalization for elderly people, especially with pathologies such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The smart environment assists these people and their families with safety and cognitive stimulation, so they stay as long as possible at home. The originality comes from using the robot in the elderly person's home. This robot is remote controlled by a distant user, a therapist or a relative, for determining alarming situations or for participating in stimulation exercises. Several modes are available for controlling the robot. This paper deals with an assisted control mode in which the remote user gives to the robot one goal and the robot reaches the goal by itself. During the robot movement, the user can dynamically change the current goal. An important hypothesis is that the robot has no a priori knowledge of its environment at the beginning. The knowledge will increase with time and the planned trajectory will be refreshed at two levels: a local one - faster but not always sufficient - and a global one - slower but which always finds a path if one exists. The idea is to work only with local information, using the robot sensors, the operator keeping the high level control.

For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need to extend beyond geometry and appearance - they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions.

Kanade,,2011,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,794--799,,"One of the fundamental requirements of an autonomous vehicle is the ability to determine its location on a map. Frequently, solutions to this localization problem rely on GPS information or use expensive three dimensional (3D) sensors. In this paper, we describe a method for long-term vehicle localization based on visual features alone. Our approach utilizes a combination of topological and metric mapping, which we call topometric localization, to encode the coarse topology of the route as well as detailed metric information required for accurate localization. A topometric map is created by driving the route once and recording a database of visual features. The vehicle then localizes by matching features to this database at runtime. Since individual feature matches are unreliable, we employ a discrete Bayes filter to estimate the most likely vehicle position using evidence from a sequence of images along the route. We illustrate the approach using an 8.8 km route through an urban and suburban environment.

In this paper, we exploit recent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is assigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the problem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.), Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map.

Hu,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2020,IEEE INSPEC Non-Controlled Terms,1555--1565,25,"This article investigates long-term positioning of moving objects by monocular vision of a miniature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. It is challenging to perform a real-time onboard vision processing task, due to the strict payload capacity and power budget limitations of microflying vehicles. We propose a parallel onboard architecture that explicitly decouples the long-term positioning task into iteratively operated detection, tracking, and localization. The proposed approach is eventually called onboard detection-tracking-localization, namely oDTL. The detector automatically extracts and identifies the object from image frames captured at in-flight durations. A learning-based network is constructed to improve detection accuracy and robustness against ever-changing outdoor illumination conditions and flying viewpoints. The tracker follows the object within specified region-of-interest from frame to frame with lower computing consumption. To further reduce target-losing rate, a concept of blind zone is proposed and applied, and its boundaries in sequential images are also theoretically inferred. The position estimator maps the flying vehicle pose, the image coordinates, and calibration specifications into real-world positions of the moving target. An extended Kalman filter is developed for rough position estimation, and a smooth module is introduced for the refinement of the position.

We proposed a localization method called PointLocalization. PointLocalization allows us to fuse different kinds of odometers, which can optimize the accuracy and frequency of localization results. We evaluate our algorithm on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) using LiDAR and a wheel encoder, and obtain the localization results at more than 20 Hz after fusion.

Using common GNSS the ego position can be measured but not with the reliability and precision necessary. An alternative approach to achieve precise localization is the usage of visual landmarks observed by a camera mounted in the vehicle. However, this raises the necessity of reliable visual landmarks that are easily recognizable and persistent. We propose a novel SLAM algorithm that focuses on learning and mapping such visual long-term landmarks (LLamas). The algorithm therefore processes stereo image streams from several recording sessions in the same spatial area. The key part within LLama-SLAM is the assessment of the landmarks with quality values that are inferred as viewpoint dependent probabilities from observation statistics. By adding solely landmarks of high quality to the final LLama Map, it can be kept compact while still allowing reliable localization.

Nebot,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2021,IEEE Index Terms,1--14,,"For autonomous vehicles to operate persistently in a typical urban environment, it is essential to have high accuracy position information. This requires a mapping and localisation system that can adapt to changes over time. A localisation approach based on a single-survey map will not be suitable for long-term operation as it does not incorporate variations in the environment. In this paper, we present new algorithms to maintain a featured-based map. A map maintenance pipeline is proposed that can continuously update a map with the most relevant features taking advantage of the changes in the surroundings. Our pipeline detects and removes transient features based on their geometrical relationships with the vehicle's pose. Newly identified features became part of a new feature map and are assessed by the pipeline as candidates for the localisation map. By purging out-of-date features and adding newly detected features, we continually update the prior map to more accurately represent the most recent environment. We have validated our approach using the USyd Campus Dataset, which includes more than 18 months of data. The results presented demonstrate that our maintenance pipeline produces a resilient map which can provide sustained localisation performance over time.",,10.1109/TITS.2021.3094485,,,,Feature extraction;Pipelines;Maintenance engineering;Transient analysis;Visualization;Autonomous vehicles;Task analysis;Long-term localisation;feature-based map;map update.,,1558-0016,,,,44698.62163,44698.62163,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Nebot,,2019,IEEE Index Terms,1173--1179,,"Mobile vehicles operating in urban navigation applications can achieve high integrity localisation with high accuracy by using maps of the surroundings. To accomplish this, the map should always have an accurate representation of the environment. Thus, it is necessary to detect and remove the map components that no longer exist in the current environment. This maintains the map compactness and dependability while simplifying the data association problem. This paper addresses the problem of deletion of transient map components by taking advantage of the geometric connection between the map and agent poses in order to establish and update the visibility of each feature. Once the map is created an initial visibility vector is associated with every map element and updated over time. The visibility of a map element which no longer exists is reduced and ultimately removed from the map. We demonstrate our approach in a 2D feature-based map composed of poles and corners extracted from information provided by a Iidar sensor.

This problem is difficult because of the following paradox: to move precisely, a mobile robot must have an accurate environment map; however, to build an accurate map, the mobile robot's sensing locations must be known precisely. In this way, simultaneous map building and localization can be seen to present a question of 'which came first, the chicken or the egg?' (The map or the motion?) When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning.<>",,10.1109/IROS.1991.174711,,,,Mobile robots;Vehicles;Sonar navigation;Robot sensing systems;Stochastic resonance;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking;Testing;National electric code;Humans,,,,,,44698.62163,44698.62163,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Automatic navigation of starship during a landing phase on Lunar surface is already solved with a help of inertial reference system aided visual algorithms. However, questions of automatic navigation of moving and flying vehicles on the Lunar surface are still open.

Long-term navigation of robots in outdoor environments introduces new challenges to enable life-long SLAM, including the strong appearance change resulting from vegetation, weather, and illumination variations across various times of the day, different days, months, or even seasons. In this paper, we propose a new shared representative appearance learning (SRAL) approach to address long-term visual place recognition. Different from previous methods using a single feature modality or a concatenation of multiple features, our SRAL method autonomously learns representative features that are shared in all scene scenarios, and then fuses the features together to represent the long-term appearance of environments observed by a robot during life-long navigation. By formulating SRAL as a regularized optimization problem, we use structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of feature modalities. In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the formulated optimization problem, which holds a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive empirical study was performed to evaluate the SRAL method using large-scale benchmark datasets, including St Lucia, CMU-VL, and Nordland datasets.

It is challenging to perform a real-time onboard vision processing task, due to the strict payload capacity and power budget limitations of microflying vehicles. We propose a parallel onboard architecture that explicitly decouples the long-term positioning task into iteratively operated detection, tracking, and localization. The proposed approach is eventually called onboard detection-tracking-localization, namely oDTL. The detector automatically extracts and identifies the object from image frames captured at in-flight durations. A learning-based network is constructed to improve detection accuracy and robustness against ever-changing outdoor illumination conditions and flying viewpoints. The tracker follows the object within specified region-of-interest from frame to frame with lower computing consumption. To further reduce target-losing rate, a concept of blind zone is proposed and applied, and its boundaries in sequential images are also theoretically inferred. The position estimator maps the flying vehicle pose, the image coordinates, and calibration specifications into real-world positions of the moving target. An extended Kalman filter is developed for rough position estimation, and a smooth module is introduced for the refinement of the position.

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations - which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources.

In order to handle input uncertainties as well as further analyze the interaction between the input and the antecedent fuzzy sets (FSs) of nonsingleton fuzzy logic controllers (NSFLCs), an input uncertainty sensitivity enhanced NSFLC has been developed in robot operating system using the C++ programming language. Based on recent advances in nonsingleton inference, the centroid of the intersection of the input and antecedent FSs (Cen-NSFLC) is utilized to calculate the firing strength of each rule instead of the maximum of the intersection used in traditional NSFLC (Tra-NSFLC). An 8-shaped trajectory, consisting of straight and curved lines, is used for the real-time validation of the proposed controllers for a trajectory following problem. An accurate monocular keyframe-based visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach is used to estimate the position of the quadrotor UAV in GPS-denied unknown environments. The performance of the Cen-NSFLC is compared with a conventional proportional-integral derivative (PID) controller, a singleton FLC and a Tra-NSFLC. All controllers are evaluated for different flight speeds, thus introducing different levels of uncertainty into the control problem. Visual-inertial SLAM-based real-time quadrotor UAV flight tests demonstrate that not only does the Cen-NSFLC achieve the best control performance among the four controllers, but it also shows better control performance when compared to their singleton counterparts.

Zhang,,2018,IEEE Abstract,5175--5181,,"Over the recent years, long-term place recognition has attracted an increasing attention to detect loops for largescale Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in loopy environments during long-term autonomy. Almost all existing methods are designed to work with traditional cameras with a limited field of view. Recent advances in omnidirectional sensors offer a robot an opportunity to perceive the entire surrounding environment. However, no work has existed thus far to research how omnidirectional sensors can help long-term place recognition, especially when multiple types of omnidirectional sensory data are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to integrate observations obtained from multiple sensors from different viewing angles in the omnidirectional observation in order to perform multi-directional place recognition in longterm autonomy. Our approach also answers two new questions when omnidirectional multisensory data is available for place recognition, including whether it is possible to recognize a place with long-term appearance variations when robots approach it from various directions, and whether observations from various viewing angles are the same informative. To evaluate our approach and hypothesis, we have collected the first large-scale dataset that consists of omnidirectional multisensory (intensity and depth) data collected in urban and suburban environments across a year.

Therefore, the required resources in terms of memory and processing power are growing over time. In our approach, the absolute number of landmarks can be restricted by an upper bound since we introduce a method to specifically select and replace landmarks once the upper bound has been reached.

Zhang,,2020,IEEE Abstract,1070--1076,,"Place recognition is an important component for simultaneously localization and mapping in a variety of robotics applications. Recently, several approaches using landmark information to represent a place showed promising performance to address long-term environment changes. However, previous approaches do not explicitly consider changes of the landmarks, i,e., old landmarks may disappear and new ones often appear over time. In addition, representations used in these approaches to represent landmarks are limited, based upon visual or spatial cues only. In this paper, we introduce a novel worst-case graph matching approach that integrates spatial relationships of landmarks with their appearances for long-term place recognition. Our method designs a graph representation to encode distance and angular spatial relationships as well as visual appearances of landmarks in order to represent a place. Then, we formulate place recognition as a graph matching problem under the worst-case scenario. Our approach matches places by computing the similarities of distance and angular spatial relationships of the landmarks that have the least similar appearances (i.e., worst-case). If the worst appearance similarity of landmarks is small, two places are identified to be not the same, even though their graph representations have high spatial relationship similarities.

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of open-source state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms with respect to challenging conditions such as fast motion, non-uniform illumination, and dynamic scenes. The experiments are performed with perturbations present both independently of each other, as well as in combination in long-term deployment settings in unconstrained environments (lifelong operation).The detailed results (approx. 20,000 experiments) along with comprehensive documentation of the benchmarking tool for integrating new datasets and evaluating SLAM algorithms not studied in this work are available at https://robustslam.github.io/evaluation.",,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636814,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Systematics;Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Perturbation methods;Dynamics;Lighting,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

While experience-based mapping has proven to be an effective technique for bridging the `appearance gap,' the number of experiences required for reliable metric localization over days or months can be very large, and methods for reducing the necessary number of experiences are needed for this approach to scale. Taking inspiration from color constancy theory, we learn a nonlinear RGB-to-grayscale mapping that explicitly maximizes the number of inlier feature matches for images captured under different lighting and weather conditions, and use it as a pre-processing step in a conventional single-experience localization pipeline to improve its robustness to appearance change. We train this mapping by approximating the target non-differentiable localization pipeline with a deep neural network, and find that incorporating a learned low-dimensional context feature can further improve cross-appearance feature matching. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in localization performance across day-night cycles, enabling continuous metric localization over a 30-hour period using a single mapping experience, and allowing experience-based localization to scale to long deployments with dramatically reduced data requirements.",,10.1109/LRA.2020.2967659,,,,Pipelines;Feature extraction;Visualization;Training;Measurement;Lighting;Robustness;Deep learning in robotics and automation;visual learning;visual-based navigation;localization,,2377-3766,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

In the case that a bathymetric map is not available, the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm is required, but this increases computational complexity and memory requirement. Panel-based bathymetric SLAM could considerably reduce the computational burden. However, it may suffers from incorrect update when the vehicle does not belong to the updated panel.

This problem is difficult because of the following paradox: to move precisely, a mobile robot must have an accurate environment map; however, to build an accurate map, the mobile robot's sensing locations must be known precisely. In this way, simultaneous map building and localization can be seen to present a question of 'which came first, the chicken or the egg?' (The map or the motion?) When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning.<>",,10.1109/IROS.1991.174711,,,,Mobile robots;Vehicles;Sonar navigation;Robot sensing systems;Stochastic resonance;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking;Testing;National electric code;Humans,,,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Our approach utilizes a combination of topological and metric mapping, which we call topometric localization, to encode the coarse topology of the route as well as detailed metric information required for accurate localization. A topometric map is created by driving the route once and recording a database of visual features. The vehicle then localizes by matching features to this database at runtime. Since individual feature matches are unreliable, we employ a discrete Bayes filter to estimate the most likely vehicle position using evidence from a sequence of images along the route. We illustrate the approach using an 8.8 km route through an urban and suburban environment.

Long-term navigation of robots in outdoor environments introduces new challenges to enable life-long SLAM, including the strong appearance change resulting from vegetation, weather, and illumination variations across various times of the day, different days, months, or even seasons. In this paper, we propose a new shared representative appearance learning (SRAL) approach to address long-term visual place recognition. Different from previous methods using a single feature modality or a concatenation of multiple features, our SRAL method autonomously learns representative features that are shared in all scene scenarios, and then fuses the features together to represent the long-term appearance of environments observed by a robot during life-long navigation. By formulating SRAL as a regularized optimization problem, we use structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of feature modalities. In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the formulated optimization problem, which holds a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive empirical study was performed to evaluate the SRAL method using large-scale benchmark datasets, including St Lucia, CMU-VL, and Nordland datasets.

An image model named bearing angle (BA) is adopted to convert 3-D laser points to 2-D images, and then ORB features extracted from BA images are utilized to perform scene matching. Since the computational cost for matching a query BA image with all the BA images in a database is too high to meet the requirement of performing real-time place recognition, a visual bag of words approach is used to improve search efficiency.

However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, everything changes and nothing stands still,  and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment.

When modelling the geometric consistency within adjacent frames, most deep VO methods ignore the temporal continuity of the camera pose, which results in a very severe jagged fluctuation in the velocity curves. With the observation that road vehicles tend to perform smooth dynamic characteristics in most of the time, we design the inertia loss function to describe the abnormal motion variation, which assists the model to learn the consecutiveness from long-term camera ego-motion. Based on the recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture, our method implicitly models the dynamics of road vehicles and the temporal consecutiveness by the extended Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) block.

Newman,,2015,IEEE Abstract,90--97,,"This paper is about life-long vast-scale localisation in spite of changes in weather, lighting and scene structure. Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations - which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources.

Darji,,2021,IEEE Abstract,1109--1114,,"Underground water pipes are important to any country's infrastructure. Overtime, the metallic pipes are prone to corrosion, which can lead to water leakage and pipe bursts. In order to prolong the service life of those assets, water utilities in Australia apply protective pipe linings. Long-term monitoring and timely intervention are crucial for maintaining those lining assets. However, the water utilities do not possess the comprehensive technology to achieve it. The main reasons for lacking such technology are the unavailability of sensors and accurate robot localization technologies. Feature based localization methods such as SLAM has limited use as the application of liners alters the features and the environment. Encoder based localization is not accurate enough to observe the evolution of defects over a long period of time requiring unique defect correspondence. This motivates us to explore accurate contact-less and wireless based localization methods. We propose a cost-effective localization method using UHF-RFID signals for robot localization inside pipelines based on Gaussian process combined particle filter. Experiments carried out in field extracted pipe samples from the Sydney water pipe network show that using the RSSI and Phase data together in the measurement model with particle filter algorithm improves the localization accuracy up to 15 centimeters precision.",,10.1109/ICIEA51954.2021.9516284,,,,Location awareness;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Phase measurement;Service robots;Pipelines;infrastructure robotics;linings;localization;particle filter;pipes;robotics for smart cities;RFID;robotic inspections;UHF-RFID,,2158-2297,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,
,Generic Node Removal for Factor-Graph SLAM,N. Carlevaris-Bianco and M. Kaess and R. M. Eustice,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2014,IEEE Index Terms,1371--1385,30,"This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a ChowLiu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for 34.9 h of real-world indoor-outdoor data covering 147.4 km collected over 27 mapping sessions spanning a period of 15 months.",,10.1109/TRO.2014.2347571,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Optimization;Approximation methods;Correlation;Mobile robots;Factor-graphs;long-term autonomy;marginalization;mobile robotics;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);Factor-graphs;long-term autonomy;marginalization;mobile robotics;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),,1941-0468,,,,44698.62163,44698.62421,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,
,Geometry-based Graph Pruning for Lifelong SLAM,G. Kurz and M. Holoch and P. Biber,,2021,IEEE Index Terms,3313--3320,,"Lifelong SLAM considers long-term operation of a robot where already mapped locations are revisited many times in changing environments. As a result, traditional graph-based SLAM approaches eventually become extremely slow due to the continuous growth of the graph and the loss of sparsity. Both problems can be addressed by a graph pruning algorithm. It carefully removes vertices and edges to keep the graph size reasonable while preserving the information needed to provide good SLAM results. We propose a novel method that considers geometric criteria for choosing the vertices to be pruned. It is efficient, easy to implement, and leads to a graph with evenly spread vertices that remain part of the robot trajectory. Furthermore, we present a novel approach of marginalization that is more robust to wrong loop closures than existing methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two publicly available real-world long-term datasets and compared to the unpruned case as well as ground truth. We show that even on a long dataset (25h), our approach manages to keep the graph sparse and the speed high while still providing good accuracy (40 times speed up, 6cm map error compared to unpruned case).",,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636530,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Costs;Density functional theory;Trajectory;Standards;Intelligent robots,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62163,44698.62426,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

We assume that some of the hidden processes that influence the dynamic environment states are periodic and model the uncertainty of the estimated state variables by their frequency spectra. The spectral model can represent arbitrary timescales of environment dynamics with low memory requirements. Transformation of the spectral model to the time domain allows for the prediction of the future environment states, which improves the robot's long-term performance in changing environments.

,ExMaps: Long-Term Localization in Dynamic Scenes using Exponential Decay,A. Rotsidis and C. Lutteroth and P. Hall and C. Richardt,,2021,IEEE Index Terms,2866--2875,,"Visual camera localization using offline maps is widespread in robotics and mobile applications. Most state-of-the-art localization approaches assume static scenes, so maps are often reconstructed once and then kept constant. However, many scenes are dynamic and as changes in the scene happen, future localization attempts may struggle or fail entirely. Therefore, it is important for successful long-term localization to update and maintain maps as new observations of the scene, and changes in it, arrive. We propose a novel method for automatically discovering which points in a map remain stable over time, and which are due to transient changes. To this end, we calculate a stability store for each point based on its visibility over time, weighted by an exponential decay over time. This allows us to consider the impact of time when scoring points, and to distinguish which points are useful for long-term localization. We evaluate our method on the CMU Extended Seasons dataset (outdoors) and a new indoor dataset of a retail shop, and show the benefit of maintaining a `live map' that integrates updates over time using our exponential decay based method over a static `base map'.",,10.1109/WACV48630.2021.00291,,,,Location awareness;Visualization;Computer vision;Conferences;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Mobile applications,,2642-9381,,,,44698.62163,44698.62412,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Stumm,,2016,IEEE Index Terms,4572--4579,,"Precisely estimating the pose of an agent in a global reference frame is a crucial goal that unlocks a multitude of robotic applications, including autonomous navigation and collaboration. In order to achieve this, current state-of-the-art localization approaches collect data provided by one or more agents and create a single, consistent localization map, maintained over time. However, with the introduction of lengthier sorties and the growing size of the environments, data transfers between the backend server where the global map is stored and the agents are becoming prohibitively large. While some existing methods partially address this issue by building compact summary maps, the data transfer from the agents to the backend can still easily become unmanageable. In this paper, we propose a method that is designed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the agent to the backend, functioning in large-scale, multi-session mapping scenarios. Our approach is based upon a landmark selection method that exploits information coming from multiple, possibly weak and correlated, landmark utility predictors; fused using learned feature coefficients. Such a selection yields a drastic reduction in data transfer while maintaining localization performance and the ability to efficiently summarize environments over time. We evaluate our approach on a data set that was autonomously collected in a dynamic indoor environment over a period of several months.",,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759673,,,,Robots;Measurement;Bandwidth;Lighting;Data transfer;Servers;Reliability,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62163,44698.62409,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

Chen,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,2022,IEEE Index Terms,313--328,9,"Visual localization is a crucial component in the application of mobile robot and autonomous driving. Image retrieval is an efficient and effective technique in image-based localization methods. Due to the drastic variability of environmental conditions, e.g., illumination changes, retrieval-based visual localization is severely affected and becomes a challenging problem. In this work, a general architecture is first formulated probabilistically to extract domain-invariant features through multi-domain image translation. Then, a novel gradient-weighted similarity activation mapping loss (Grad-SAM) is incorporated for finer localization with high accuracy. We also propose a new adaptive triplet loss to boost the contrastive learning of the embedding in a self-supervised manner. The final coarse-to-fine image retrieval pipeline is implemented as the sequential combination of models with and without Grad-SAM loss. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset. The strong generalization ability of our approach is verified with the RobotCar dataset using models pre-trained on urban parts of the CMU-Seasons dataset.

The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time.

Our approach, T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then decodes the resulting predictions. On deployment, the approach can perform on-the-fly prediction in real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15 km of pedestrian trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months.

Sharing a common map for online localization provides a fleet of autonomous vehicles with the possibility to maintain and access a consistent map source, and therefore reduce redundancy while increasing efficiency. However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.",,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759609,,,,Vehicles;Visualization;Servers;Bandwidth;Robots;Redundancy;Mobile computing,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62201,44698.62347,sousarbarb,,Duplicated,

It is a fundamental kernel that enables head-mounted augmented/virtual reality devices and autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles. A noticeable recent trend in visual SLAM is to apply computationand memory-intensive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that outperform traditional hand-designed feature-based methods [1]. For each video frame, CNN-extracted features are matched with stored keypoints to estimate the agent's 6-DoF pose by solving a perspective-n-points (PnP) non-linear optimization problem (Fig. 7.3.1, left). The agent's long-term trajectory over multiple frames is refined by a bundle adjustment process (BA, Fig. 7.3.1 right), which involves a large-scale (~120 variables) non-linear optimization. Visual SLAM requires massive computation (>250GOP/s) in the CNN-based feature extraction and matching, as well as datadependent dynamic memory access and control flow with high-precision operations, creating significant low-power design challenges.

By dividing the feature data and location data of geophysical field obtained into various submaps and sub-segments during AUV sailing, the dominant navigation data of each segment is identified using long short-term memory network. Validity of the proposed method is done by simulation experiments. During the simulation, the loop closure detection of each submap is used, and the matching counter is set to check the correct matching rate.

To empower universal localization service, this paper presents Rover, an indoor localization system that localizes multiple backscatter tags without any start-up cost using a robot equipped with inertial sensors. Rover runs in a joint optimization framework, fusing measurements from backscattered WiFi signals and inertial sensors to simultaneously estimate the locations of both the robot and the connected tags.

First, an approach to address the ever growing number of landmarks in life-long operation is presented. Typically, SLAM approaches just accumulate features over time and do not discard them anymore. Therefore, the required resources in terms of memory and processing power are growing over time. In our approach, the absolute number of landmarks can be restricted by an upper bound since we introduce a method to specifically select and replace landmarks once the upper bound has been reached.

Adaptive local maps is an algorithm which represents the occupancy information as a set of overlapping local maps anchored to poses in the robot's trajectory.

The advantage of this approach is that the occupancy information stays consistent despite the changes in the pose estimates resulting from loop closures and localization updates. The disadvantage, however, is that the number of local maps grows over time. For long robot runs, or for multiple runs in the same space, this growth will result in redundant occupancy information, which will in turn increase the time it takes to render the global map, as well as the memory footprint of the system.

However, with the introduction of lengthier sorties and the growing size of the environments, data transfers between the backend server where the global map is stored and the agents are becoming prohibitively large. While some existing methods partially address this issue by building compact summary maps, the data transfer from the agents to the backend can still easily become unmanageable. In this paper, we propose a method that is designed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the agent to the backend, functioning in large-scale, multi-session mapping scenarios.

While experience-based mapping has proven to be an effective technique for bridging the `appearance gap,' the number of experiences required for reliable metric localization over days or months can be very large, and methods for reducing the necessary number of experiences are needed for this approach to scale. Taking inspiration from color constancy theory, we learn a nonlinear RGB-to-grayscale mapping that explicitly maximizes the number of inlier feature matches for images captured under different lighting and weather conditions, and use it as a pre-processing step in a conventional single-experience localization pipeline to improve its robustness to appearance change. We train this mapping by approximating the target non-differentiable localization pipeline with a deep neural network, and find that incorporating a learned low-dimensional context feature can further improve cross-appearance feature matching.

Due to the drastic variability of environmental conditions, e.g., illumination changes, retrieval-based visual localization is severely affected and becomes a challenging problem. In this work, a general architecture is first formulated probabilistically to extract domain-invariant features through multi-domain image translation. Then, a novel gradient-weighted similarity activation mapping loss (Grad-SAM) is incorporated for finer localization with high accuracy. We also propose a new adaptive triplet loss to boost the contrastive learning of the embedding in a self-supervised manner. The final coarse-to-fine image retrieval pipeline is implemented as the sequential combination of models with and without Grad-SAM loss. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset. The strong generalization ability of our approach is verified with the RobotCar dataset using models pre-trained on urban parts of the CMU-Seasons dataset. Our performance is on par with or even outperforms the state-of-the-art image-based localization baselines in medium or high precision, especially under challenging environments with illumination variance, vegetation, and night-time images.

As a result, traditional graph-based SLAM approaches eventually become extremely slow due to the continuous growth of the graph and the loss of sparsity. Both problems can be addressed by a graph pruning algorithm. It carefully removes vertices and edges to keep the graph size reasonable while preserving the information needed to provide good SLAM results. We propose a novel method that considers geometric criteria for choosing the vertices to be pruned. It is efficient, easy to implement, and leads to a graph with evenly spread vertices that remain part of the robot trajectory. Furthermore, we present a novel approach of marginalization that is more robust to wrong loop closures than existing methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two publicly available real-world long-term datasets and compared to the unpruned case as well as ground truth.

Long-term navigation of robots in outdoor environments introduces new challenges to enable life-long SLAM, including the strong appearance change resulting from vegetation, weather, and illumination variations across various times of the day, different days, months, or even seasons. In this paper, we propose a new shared representative appearance learning (SRAL) approach to address long-term visual place recognition. Different from previous methods using a single feature modality or a concatenation of multiple features, our SRAL method autonomously learns representative features that are shared in all scene scenarios, and then fuses the features together to represent the long-term appearance of environments observed by a robot during life-long navigation. By formulating SRAL as a regularized optimization problem, we use structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of feature modalities. In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the formulated optimization problem, which holds a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive empirical study was performed to evaluate the SRAL method using large-scale benchmark datasets, including St Lucia, CMU-VL, and Nordland datasets.

However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, everything changes and nothing stands still,  and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment.

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations - which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources.

In order to handle input uncertainties as well as further analyze the interaction between the input and the antecedent fuzzy sets (FSs) of nonsingleton fuzzy logic controllers (NSFLCs), an input uncertainty sensitivity enhanced NSFLC has been developed in robot operating system using the C++ programming language. Based on recent advances in nonsingleton inference, the centroid of the intersection of the input and antecedent FSs (Cen-NSFLC) is utilized to calculate the firing strength of each rule instead of the maximum of the intersection used in traditional NSFLC (Tra-NSFLC). An 8-shaped trajectory, consisting of straight and curved lines, is used for the real-time validation of the proposed controllers for a trajectory following problem.

The performance of the Cen-NSFLC is compared with a conventional proportional-integral derivative (PID) controller, a singleton FLC and a Tra-NSFLC. All controllers are evaluated for different flight speeds, thus introducing different levels of uncertainty into the control problem. Visual-inertial SLAM-based real-time quadrotor UAV flight tests demonstrate that not only does the Cen-NSFLC achieve the best control performance among the four controllers, but it also shows better control performance when compared to their singleton counterparts.

The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a ChowLiu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Software implementations are impractical, resulting in 0.2s runtime with a ~3GHz CPU+ GPU system with >100MB memory footprint and >100W power consumption. Prior ASICs have implemented either an incomplete SLAM system [2,3] that lacks estimation of ego-motion or employed a simplified (non-CNN) feature extraction and tracking [2,4,5] that limits SLAM quality and range.

During this localization process, we exploit information collected in the beginning of the trajectory to compute a ranking function which will be used in the rest of the trajectory to retrieve from the map the keyframes that maximise the number of matched points. The retrieval depends on the geometric distance between the pose of the keyframe and the current pose of the vehicle, and the similarity of this keyframe with the current environmental condition.

Traditional localization algorithms typically assume that the environment is static. However, in many real-world applications, such as parking lots and industrial plants, there are always dynamic objects (e.g. moving people) and semi-dynamic objects (e.g. parked cars and placed goods). In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a long-term localization algorithm in the environments which combine dynamic objects and semi-dynamic objects. Localizability-based-updating particle filter (LU-P F) algorithm is proposed here. Not only we use localizability matric to build an updating mechanism, but also it is used for localization system.

Long-term visual localization in real time is particularly challenging, in which the robot is required to efficiently localize itself using visual data where appearance may change significantly over time. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based visual localization system targeting at long-term localization in real time. On the robot, we employ two estimators to achieve accurate and real-time performance. One is a sliding-window based visual inertial odometry, which integrates constraints from consecutive observations and self-motion measurements, as well as the constraints induced by localization results from the cloud. This estimator builds a local visual submap as the virtual observation which is then sent to the cloud as new localization constraints. The other one is a delayed state Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the pose of the robot localized from the cloud, the local odometry and the high-frequency inertial measurements. On the cloud, we propose a longer sliding-window based localization method to aggregate the virtual observations for larger field of view, leading to more robust alignment between virtual observations and the map. Under this architecture, the robot can achieve drift-free and real-time localization using onboard resources even in a network with limited bandwidth, high latency and existence of package loss, which enables the autonomous navigation in real-world environment.

Naiming,,2018,IEEE Index Terms,1115--1121,,"This study addresses the problem of visual change detection using a 3D point cloud (PC) map acquired by a car-like robot. With recent advances in long-term autonomous navigation, change detection under global viewpoint uncertainty has become a topic of considerable interest. In our study, we extend the traditional two-level pipeline of change detection: (1) scene registration and (2) scene comparison, to enable scalable and efficient change detection. In the traditional pipeline, the registration stage is required to align a given scene pair (i.e., query and reference PC maps) that are taken at different times into the same coordinate system, before comparing the two PCs. However, the registration stage is a time-consuming step, which makes it harder to realize a scalable change detection. Our key concept is to transform every query or reference PC beforehand into an invariant coordinate system, which should be predefined and invariant to environment changes (e.g., dynamic objects, clutters, the mapper vehicle's trajectories), so as to enable a direct comparison of spatial layout between the two different maps. The proposed framework employs an efficient bag-of-local-features (BoLF) scene model and realizes a scalable joint viewpoint-change detection.

Long-term visual navigation approaches for robot localization should be robust to these dynamics of the environment. Existing methods typically leverage feature descriptions of whole images or image regions from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Some approaches also exploit sequential information to alleviate the problem of spatially inconsistent and non-perfect image matches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning a discriminative holistic image representation which exploits the image content to create a dense and salient scene description. These salient descriptions are learnt over a variety of datasets under large perceptual changes. Such an approach enables us to precisely segment the regions of an image which are geometrically stable over large time lags. We combine features from these salient regions and an off-the-shelf holistic representation to form a more robust scene descriptor. We also introduce a semantically labeled dataset which captures extreme perceptual and structural scene dynamics over the course of 3 years.

Almost all existing methods are designed to work with traditional cameras with a limited field of view. Recent advances in omnidirectional sensors offer a robot an opportunity to perceive the entire surrounding environment. However, no work has existed thus far to research how omnidirectional sensors can help long-term place recognition, especially when multiple types of omnidirectional sensory data are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to integrate observations obtained from multiple sensors from different viewing angles in the omnidirectional observation in order to perform multi-directional place recognition in longterm autonomy. Our approach also answers two new questions when omnidirectional multisensory data is available for place recognition, including whether it is possible to recognize a place with long-term appearance variations when robots approach it from various directions, and whether observations from various viewing angles are the same informative. To evaluate our approach and hypothesis, we have collected the first large-scale dataset that consists of omnidirectional multisensory (intensity and depth) data collected in urban and suburban environments across a year.

To achieve the required localization accuracy and availability, long-term visual SLAM algorithms like LLama-SLAM are a promising option.

In this paper, we devise several approaches to compare and match feature tracks and evaluate their performance on a long-term data set.

Steinbach,,2012,IEEE Index Terms,1--10,,"We present a visual odometry system for indoor navigation with a focus on long-term robustness and consistency. As our work is targeting mobile phones, we employ monocular SLAM to jointly estimate a local map and the device's trajectory. We specifically address the problem of estimating the scale factor of both, the map and the trajectory. State-of-the-art solutions approach this problem with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which estimates the scale by fusing inertial and visual data, but strongly relies on good initialization and takes time to converge. Each visual tracking failure introduces a new arbitrary scale factor, forcing the filter to re-converge. We propose a fast and robust method for scale initialization that exploits basic geometric properties of the learned local map. Using random projections, we efficiently compute geometric properties from the feature point cloud produced by the visual SLAM system. From these properties (e.g., corridor width or height) we estimate scale changes caused by tracking failures and update the EKF accordingly. As a result, previously achieved convergence is preserved despite re-initializations of the map. To minimize the time required to continue tracking after failure, we perform recovery and re-initialization in parallel. This increases the time available for recovery and hence the likelihood for success, thus allowing almost seamless tracking. Moreover, fewer re-initializations are necessary. We evaluate our approach using extensive and diverse indoor datasets. Results demonstrate that errors and convergence times for scale estimation are considerably reduced, thus ensuring consistent and accurate scale estimation.

We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios. Further, we performed two extended experiments in a multi-robot setup to evaluate the full SLAM system, including visual robot detections and submap matches as inter-robot loop closure constraints.",,10.1109/IROS.2015.7354094,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Robot kinematics;Optimization;Visualization;Real-time systems,,,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Checkout my map: Version control for fleetwide visual localisation,M. Gadd and P. Newman,,2016,IEEE Abstract,5729--5736,,"This paper is about underpinning long-term operations of fleets of vehicles using visual localisation. In particular it examines ways in which vehicles, considered as independent agents, can share, update and leverage each others' visual experiences in a mutually beneficial way. We draw on our previous work in Experience-based Navigation (EBN) [1], in which a visual map supporting multiple representations of the same place is built, yielding real-time localisation capability for a solitary vehicle. We now consider how any number of such agents might operate in concert via data sharing policies that are germane to the shared task of lifelong localisation. We rapidly construct considerable maps by the conjoining of work distributed to asynchronous processes, and share expertise amongst the team by the selective dispensing of mission-specific map contents. We demonstrate and evaluate our system against 100km of data collected in North Oxford over a period of a month featuring diverse deviation in appearance due to atmospheric, lighting, and structural dynamics. We show that our framework is capable of creating maps in a fraction of the time required by single-agent EBN, with no significant loss in localisation robustness, and is able to furnish robots on real-world forays with maps which require much less storage.",,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759843,,,,Robot sensing systems;Servers;Databases;Visualization;Robustness;Vehicles,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Autonomous Navigation: Achievements in Complex Environments,M. E. Adams,,2006,IEEE Abstract,nil19--nil19,,"Over the past decade, challenging applications for autonomous robots have been identified, in the areas of servicing crowded, built-up areas, mining, search and rescue operations, underwater exploration and airborne surveillance. Autonomous navigation arguably remains the key enabling issue behind any realistic commercial success in these areas. Consequently, autonomous robotic research has focused on large scale and long term navigation algorithms, sensing technologies, robust sensor data interpretation and map building. The recent breakthroughs which contribute to the success of outdoor field robotics, and remaining fundamental research issues involved, will be the theme of this presentation. The most successful robot navigation algorithms to-date, have been derived from a probabilistic perspective, which takes into account vehicle motion and terrain uncertainty and sensor noise. Over the past decade, an explosion of interest in the estimation of an autonomous robot's location state, and that of its surroundings, known as simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM), is evident. New algorithms which represent uncertain information based on particle filters and Gaussian mixture models, as well as the more classical Kalman filter based techniques, are advancing the progress of a robot's long term navigation abilities. This has been significantly aided by recently affordable sensor technologies, including GPS and inertial measurement units (IMUs) as well as fast and reliable laser range finders.",,10.1109/ROBIO.2006.340225,,,,Navigation;Robot sensing systems;Surveillance;Large-scale systems;Robustness;Remotely operated vehicles;Uncertainty;Explosions;State estimation;Simultaneous localization and mapping,,,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,PHALANX: Expendable projectile sensor networks for planetary exploration,M. Dille and D. Nuch and S. Gupta and S. McCabe and N. Verzic and T. Fong and U. Wong,,2020,IEEE Abstract,1--12,,"Technologies enabling long-term, wide-ranging measurement in hard-to-reach areas are a critical need for planetary science inquiry. Phenomena of interest include flows or variations in volatiles, gas composition or concentration, particulate density, or even simply temperature. Improved measurement of these processes enables understanding of exotic geologies and distributions or correlating indicators of trapped water or biological activity. However, such data is often needed in unsafe areas such as caves, lava tubes, or steep ravines not easily reached by current spacecraft and planetary robots. To address this capability gap, we have developed miniaturized, expendable sensors which can be ballistically lobbed from a robotic rover or static lander - or even dropped during a flyover. These projectiles can perform sensing during flight and after anchoring to terrain features. By augmenting exploration systems with these sensors, we can extend situational awareness, perform long-duration monitoring, and reduce utilization of primary mobility resources, all of which are crucial in surface missions. We call the integrated payload that includes a cold gas launcher, smart projectiles, planning software, network discovery, and science sensing: PHALANX. In this paper, we introduce the mission architecture for PHALANX and describe an exploration concept that pairs projectile sensors with a rover mothership. Science use cases explored include reconnaissance using ballistic cameras, volatiles detection, and building timelapse maps of temperature and illumination conditions. Strategies to autonomously coordinate constellations of deployed sensors to self-discover and localize with peer ranging (i.e. a local GPS) are summarized, thus providing communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) of the rover. Capabilities were demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing with a terrestrial prototype. The approach to developing a terrestrial prototype is discussed, including design of the launching mechanism, projectile optimization, micro-electronics fabrication, and sensor selection. Results from early testing and characterization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are reported. Nodes were subjected to successful burn-in tests over 48 hours at full logging duty cycle. Integrated field tests were conducted in the Roverscape, a half-acre planetary analog environment at NASA Ames, where we tested up to 10 sensor nodes simultaneously coordinating with an exploration rover. Ranging accuracy has been demonstrated to be within +/-10cm over 20m using commodity radios when compared to high-resolution laser scanner ground truthing. Evolution of the design, including progressive miniaturization of the electronics and iterated modifications of the enclosure housing for streamlining and optimized radio performance are described.

Nieto,,2016,IEEE Abstract,4137--4143,,"In this paper, we present an online landmark selection method for distributed long-term visual localization systems in bandwidth-constrained environments. Sharing a common map for online localization provides a fleet of autonomous vehicles with the possibility to maintain and access a consistent map source, and therefore reduce redundancy while increasing efficiency. However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.",,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759609,,,,Vehicles;Visualization;Servers;Bandwidth;Robots;Redundancy;Mobile computing,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Active airborne localisation and exploration in unknown environments using inertial SLAM,M. Bryson and S. Sukkarieh,,2006,IEEE Abstract,13pp.--,,"Future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications will require high-accuracy localisation in environments in which navigation infrastructure such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and prior terrain maps may be unavailable or unreliable. In these applications, long-term operation requires the vehicle to build up a spatial map of the environment while simultaneously localising itself within the map, a task known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). In the first part of this paper we present an architecture for performing inertial-sensor based SLAM on an aerial vehicle. We demonstrate an on-line path planning scheme that intelligently plans the vehicle's trajectory while exploring unknown terrain in order to maximise the quality of both the resulting SLAM map and localisation estimates necessary for the autonomous control of the UAV. Two important performance properties and their relationship to the dynamic motion and path planning systems on-board the UAV are analysed. Firstly we analyse information-based measures such as entropy. Secondly we perform an observability analysis of inertial SLAM by recasting the algorithms into an indirect error model form. Qualitative knowledge gained from the observability analysis is used to assist in the design of an information-based trajectory planner for the UAV. Results of the online path planning algorithm are presented using a high-fidelity 6-DoF simulation of a UAV during a simulated navigation and mapping task.",,10.1109/AERO.2006.1655801,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Path planning;Navigation;Global Positioning System;Remotely operated vehicles;Performance analysis;Information analysis;Observability;Terrain mapping;Navigation;Mapping;SLAM;Autonomous Vehicles;Observability,,1095-323X,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Duckett,,2018,IEEE Abstract,5942--5948,,"This paper presents a novel 3DOF pedestrian trajectory prediction approach for autonomous mobile service robots. While most previously reported methods are based on learning of 2D positions in monocular camera images, our approach uses range-finder sensors to learn and predict 3DOF pose trajectories (i.e. 2D position plus 1D rotation within the world coordinate system). Our approach, T-Pose-LSTM (Temporal 3DOF-Pose Long-Short-Term Memory), is trained using long-term data from real-world robot deployments and aims to learn context-dependent (environment- and time-specific) human activities. Our approach incorporates long-term temporal information (i.e. date and time) with short-term pose observations as input. A sequence-to-sequence LSTM encoder-decoder is trained, which encodes observations into LSTM and then decodes the resulting predictions. On deployment, the approach can perform on-the-fly prediction in real-time. Instead of using manually annotated data, we rely on a robust human detection, tracking and SLAM system, providing us with examples in a global coordinate system. We validate the approach using more than 15 km of pedestrian trajectories recorded in a care home environment over a period of three months. The experiments show that the proposed T-Pose-LSTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D-based method for human trajectory prediction in long-term mobile robot deployments.",,10.1109/ICRA.2018.8461228,,,,Trajectory;Cameras;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Two dimensional displays;Mobile robots,,2577-087X,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Incremental unsupervised topological place discovery,L. Murphy and G. Sibley,,2014,IEEE Abstract,1312--1318,,"This paper describes an online place discovery and recognition engine that fuses information over time to create topologically distinct places. A key motivation is the recognition that a single image may be a poor exemplar of what constitutes a place. Images are not `places' nor are they `documents'. Instead, by treating image-sequences as a multimodal distribution over topics - and by discovering topics incrementally and online - it is possible to both reduce the memory footprint of place recognition systems, and to improve precision and recall. Distinctive key-places are represented by a cluster topics found from the covisibility graph of a relative simultaneous localization and mapping engine - key-places inherently span many images. A dynamic vocabulary of visual words and density based clustering is used to continually estimate a set of visual topics, changes in which drive the place-recognition process. The system is evaluated using an indoor robot sequence, a standard outdoor robot sequence and a long-term sequence from a static camera. Experiments demonstrate qualitatively distinct themes associated with discovered places - from common place types such as `hallway', or `desk-area', to temporal concepts such as `dusk', `dawn' or `mid-day'. Compared to traditional image-based place-recognition, this reduces the information that must be stored without reducing place-recognition performance.",,10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907022,,,,Vocabulary;Visualization;Robots;Semantics;Streaming media;Image recognition;Engines,,1050-4729,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

In this scenario, the navigation system needs to continuously update and refine its feature map in order to adapt to the environment appearance change. To achieve reliable long-term navigation, the map management techniques have to (i) select features useful for the current navigation task, (ii) remove features that are obsolete, (iii) and add new features from the current camera view to the map. We propose several map management strategies and evaluate their performance with regard to the robot localisation accuracy in long-term teach-and-repeat navigation.

Reimer,IEEE Access,2019,IEEE Abstract,102021--102038,7,"Today, and possibly for a long time to come, the full driving task is too complex an activity to be fully formalized as a sensing-acting robotics system that can be explicitly solved through model-based and learning-based approaches in order to achieve full unconstrained vehicle autonomy. Localization, mapping, scene perception, vehicle control, trajectory optimization, and higher-level planning decisions associated with autonomous vehicle development remain full of open challenges. This is especially true for unconstrained, real-world operation where the margin of allowable error is extremely small and the number of edge-cases is extremely large. Until these problems are solved, human beings will remain an integral part of the driving task, monitoring the AI system as it performs anywhere from just over 0% to just under 100% of the driving. The governing objectives of the MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology (MIT-AVT) study are to 1) undertake large-scale real-world driving data collection that includes high-definition video to fuel the development of deep learning-based internal and external perception systems; 2) gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with vehicle automation technology by integrating video data with vehicle state data, driver characteristics, mental models, and self-reported experiences with technology; and 3) identify how technology and other factors related to automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives. In pursuing these objectives, we have instrumented 23 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, 2 Volvo S90 vehicles, 2 Range Rover Evoque, and 2 Cadillac CT6 vehicles for both long-term (over a year per driver) and medium-term (one month per driver) naturalistic driving data collection.

,Appearance-Based Loop Closure Detection via Locality-Driven Accurate Motion Field Learning,K. Zhang and X. Jiang and J. Ma,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2022,IEEE Abstract,2350--2365,23,"Loop closure detection (LCD) is of significant importance in simultaneous localization and mapping. It represents the robots ability to recognize whether the current surrounding corresponds to a previously observed one. In this paper, we conduct this task in a two-step strategy: candidate frame selection and loop closure verification. The first step aims to search semantically similar images for the query one using features obtained by Key.Net with HardNet. Instead of adopting the traditional Bag-of-Words strategy, we utilize the aggregated selective match kernel to calculate the similarity between images. Subsequently, based on the potential property of motion field in the LCD scene, we propose a novel feature matching method, i.e., exploiting the smoothness prior and learning the motion field for an image pair in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), to implement loop closure verification. Concretely, we formulate the learning problem into a Bayesian framework with latent variables indicating the true/false correspondences and a mixture model accounting for the distribution of data. Furthermore, we propose a locality-driven mechanism to enhance the local relevance of motion vectors and term the algorithm as locality-driven accurate motion field learning (LAL). To satisfy the requirement of efficiency in the LCD task, we use a sparse approximation and search a suboptimal solution for the motion field in the RKHS, termed as LAL*. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets for feature matching and LCD tasks. The quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the current state-of-the-art, meanwhile showing its potential for long-term visual localization.

Shen,,2017,IEEE Abstract,1783--1789,,"Robust state estimation and real-time dense mapping are two core capabilities for autonomous navigation of mobile robots. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and visual odometry/SLAM are popular methods for state estimation. However, when working between tall buildings or in indoor environments, GNSS fails due to limited sky view or obstruction from buildings. Visual odometry/SLAM are prone to long-term drifting in the absence of reliable loop closure detection. A state estimation method with global-consistent guarantee is desirable for navigation applications. As for real-time mapping, SLAM methods usually get a sparse map that is not good enough for obstacle avoidance and path-planning, and high-quality dense mapping is often computationally too demanding for mobile devices. Realizing the availability of city-scale 3D models, in this work, we improve our previous work on model-based global localization, and propose a model-aided monocular visual-inertial state estimation and dense mapping solution. We first develop a global-consistent state estimator by fusing visual-inertial odometry with the model-based localization results. Utilizing depth prior from the model, we perform motion stereo with semi-global disparity smoothing.

In this research, we extend the continuous localization technique by adding a learning component. This allows continuous localization to update the long-term map (evidence grid) with current sensor readings.

This combines lightweight, yet powerful HD maps with the simplicity of monocular vision and the flexibility of neural networks.The major challenges arising from this combination are data association and robustness against misdetections. Association is solved efficiently by applying distance transform on binary per-class images. This provides not only a fast lookup table for a smooth gradient as needed for pose-graph optimization, but also dynamic association by default.A sliding-window pose graph optimization combines single image detections with vehicle odometry, smoothing results and helping overcome even misclassifications in consecutive frames.Evaluation against a highly accurate 6D visual localization shows that our approach can achieve accuracy levels as required for automated driving, being one of the most lightweight and flexible methods to do so.",,10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341003,,,,Location awareness;Semantics;Neural networks;Transforms;Cameras;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

This requires a mapping and localisation system that can adapt to changes over time. A localisation approach based on a single-survey map will not be suitable for long-term operation as it does not incorporate variations in the environment. In this paper, we present new algorithms to maintain a featured-based map. A map maintenance pipeline is proposed that can continuously update a map with the most relevant features taking advantage of the changes in the surroundings. Our pipeline detects and removes transient features based on their geometrical relationships with the vehicle's pose. Newly identified features became part of a new feature map and are assessed by the pipeline as candidates for the localisation map. By purging out-of-date features and adding newly detected features, we continually update the prior map to more accurately represent the most recent environment.

,Identifying robust landmarks in feature-based maps,J. S. Berrio and J. Ward and S. Worrall and E. Nebot,,2019,IEEE Abstract,1166--1172,,"To operate in an urban environment, an automated vehicle must be capable of accurately estimating its position within a global map reference frame. This is necessary for optimal path planning and safe navigation. To accomplish this over an extended period of time, the global map requires long term maintenance. This includes the addition of newly observable features and the removal of transient features belonging to dynamic objects. The latter is especially important for the long-term use of the map as matching against a map with features that no longer exist can result in incorrect data associations, and consequently erroneous localisation. This paper addresses the problem of removing features from the map that correspond to objects that are no longer observable/present in the environment. This is achieved by assigning a single score which depends on the geometric distribution and characteristics when the features are re-detected (or not) on different occasions. Our approach not only eliminates ephemeral features, but can also be used as a reduction algorithm for highly dense maps. We tested our approach using half a year of weekly drives over the same 500 metre section of road in an urban environment. The results presented demonstrate the validity of the long term approach to map maintenance.",,10.1109/IVS.2019.8814289,,,,Feature extraction;Navigation;Maintenance engineering;Vehicle dynamics;Meters;Reliability;Trajectory,,2642-7214,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

A three-mission campaign concept is currently being investigated. The Mars 2020 rover mission is intended to core and collect samples.

Kim,IEEE Access,2022,IEEE Abstract,10806--10815,10,"In a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-restricted area, a mobile robot navigation system exploits surrounding environment information. For an aerial or underwater vehicle, undulating terrain of a land or seabed surface is a valuable information resource that leads to the development of terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) algorithms. However, due to the vast amount of a vehicles activity area, surveying all the regions to obtain a high-resolution terrain map is impractical and requires simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) as a highly desirable capability. This paper presents a topographic SLAM algorithm using only a single terrain altimeter, which is low-cost, computationally efficient, and sufficiently stable for long-term operation. The proposed rectangular panel map structure and update method enable robust and efficient SLAM.

These methods assume Markov independence of observations, implying that observations made by a robot correspond to a static map. However, in real human environments, observations include occlusions due to unmapped objects like chairs and tables, and dynamic objects like humans. We introduce an episodic non-Markov localization algorithm that maintains estimates of the belief over the trajectory of the robot while explicitly reasoning about observations and their correlations arising from unmapped static objects, moving objects, as well as objects from the static map. Observations are classified as arising from long-term features, short-term features, or dynamic features, which correspond to mapped objects, unmapped static objects, and unmapped dynamic objects respectively. By detecting time steps along the robot's trajectory where unmapped observations prior to such time steps are unrelated to those afterwards, non-Markov localization limits the history of observations and pose estimates to episodes over which the belief is computed.

Existing approaches focus on either stairway detection or traversal, but do not address these problems in the context of path planning for the autonomous exploration of multi-floor buildings. We propose a system for detecting and modeling ascending stairways while performing simultaneous localization and mapping, such that the traversability of each stairway can be assessed by estimating its physical properties. The long-term objective of our approach is to enable exploration of multiple floors of a building by allowing stairways to be considered during path planning as traversable portals to new frontiers. We design a generative model of a stairway as a single object. We localize these models with respect to the map, and estimate the dimensions of the stairway as a whole, as well as its steps. With these estimates, a robot can determine if the stairway is traversable based on its climbing capabilities. Our system consists of two parts: a computationally efficient detector that leverages geometric cues from dense depth imagery to detect sets of ascending stairs, and a stairway modeler that uses multiple detections to infer the location and parameters of a stairway that is discovered during exploration.

Many Lunar robotics missions are planned in near future by different space agencies around the world. Moon has considered to be the best place for a research station with long-term human presence for finding answers on fundamental questions about the universe. Automatic navigation of starship during a landing phase on Lunar surface is already solved with a help of inertial reference system aided visual algorithms. However, questions of automatic navigation of moving and flying vehicles on the Lunar surface are still open. Inertial navigation is limited by time, self-localization and mapping algorithms require multiple unique features of relief to guarantee required accuracy for successful automatic mission complication. In the current study, we propose the deployment of a network of visual navigational aids on the Lunar surface to support ground automatic missions. A weak atmosphere of the Moon makes effective visual beacons navigation system for long areas. A network of navigational aids includes primary and secondary ground stations which are blinking synchronously. Synchronization is supported by radio waves from the primary ground station.

,Use of classification and segmentation of sidescan sonar images for long term registration,I. Leblond and M. Legris and B. Solaiman,,2005,IEEE Abstract,322--327Vol.1,1,"This article handles the possibility of using classification and segmentation of sidescan sonar images for long term registration. In our case, long term registration means to find the displacement between two images which can have been mapped with many weeks or many months between them. The aim of this study is to help AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) to navigate, in particular to correct the drift of navigation sensors. This type of positioning raises two sorts of problems, which come from image properties: spatial variability and temporal variability. The first one is caused above all by the sonar geometry and appears for example like a modification of the shape or the position of the shadow according to the point of view. This effect can also be seen in textures, for example on megaripples of sand, which can be more or less visible depending on the point of view of the sonar. The second one is more the consequence of the seafloor physics: between two images, mapped at different times, some elements may have changed. An obvious example is the presence of evanescent ""objects"" like fishes but this variability can also be seen on sediments, which borders can move due to local bottom dynamics. With the aim to solve these problems and to provide reliable landmarks for matching, we decided to classify and segment the images. The data have first been corrected from TVG (time varying gain) effects and despeckelised in order to process images which are more representative of the seafloor. The basis idea is to use a supervised method of classification. To do that, we consider some parameters which are coming from a decomposition by Gabor filters, in order to segment with linear discriminant analysis and use of the nearest neighbour method. Registration needs accurately localised landmarks: so, this operation is split in several stages, refining step by step the classification, in order to obtain a map which describes the seafloor with the most possible detailed frontiers. Then, we present the obtained results considering five texture classes: rocks, megaripples, sand, mud and shadow. These several areas and their frontiers are the basis landmarks to match the images. However, before using the segmentation, we must check its reliability. So, it appears that the frontiers, though they are realistic, are not accurate enough to make a registration precise to few pixels, especially in rock areas. Similarly, according to the orientation of the ripples, they may be seen as ripples or sand. These observations are due to the directivity of the sonar, which caused these effects on the segmentation. To do registration, we must take into account these problems. So, the results of the segmentation will be used only for a coarse registration, in order to find quickly the area of interest but also to assess the reliability of our registration (matching on ripples areas is a priori less reliable than on rocks areas). The results of registration are shown, proving the good adequacy between reference image and test image. Others methods, more quantitative, will be able to be tested, to refine the results.",,10.1109/OCEANSE.2005.1511734,,,,Image segmentation;Sonar navigation;Sea floor;Testing;Underwater vehicles;Geometry;Shape;Physics;Marine animals;Sediments,,,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

We show how probabilistically modelling the noisy local velocity estimates from the horizontal laser feed, fusing these estimates with data from the declined LIDAR to form a dense 3D swathe and matching this swathe statistically within a map will allow for robust, long-term position estimation. We accommodate estimation errors induced by passing vehicles, pedestrians, ground-strike etc., by learning a positional-dependent sensor model - that is, a sensor-model that varies spatially - and show that learning such a model for LIDAR data allows us to deal gracefully with the complexities of realworld data.

Specifically, we present a semi-handcrafted feature learning method for 3D Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds using artificial statistics and siamese network, which transforms the place recognition problem into a similarity modeling problem. Additionally, the sensor data using dimension reduced representations require less storage space and make the searching easier. With the learned representations by networks and the global poses, a prior map is built and used in the localization framework. In the localization step, position only observations obtained by place recognition are used in a particle filter algorithm to achieve precise pose estimation.

The size of the pose graph has a substantial influence on the runtime and the memory requirements of a SLAM system, which hinders long-term mapping. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient information-theoretic compression of pose graphs. Our approach estimates the expected information gain of laser measurements with respect to the resulting occupancy grid map. It allows for restricting the size of the pose graph depending on the information that the robot acquires about the environment or based on a given memory limit, which results in an any-space SLAM system. When discarding laser scans, our approach marginalizes out the corresponding pose nodes from the graph. To avoid a densely connected pose graph, which would result from exact marginalization, we propose an approximation to marginalization that is based on local Chow-Liu trees and maintains a sparse graph. Real world experiments suggest that our approach effectively reduces the growth of the pose graph while minimizing the loss of information in the resulting grid map.",,10.1109/IROS.2011.6094414,,,,Measurement by laser beam;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Approximation methods;Lasers;Mutual information;Laser beams,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

,Geometry-based Graph Pruning for Lifelong SLAM,G. Kurz and M. Holoch and P. Biber,,2021,IEEE Abstract,3313--3320,,"Lifelong SLAM considers long-term operation of a robot where already mapped locations are revisited many times in changing environments. As a result, traditional graph-based SLAM approaches eventually become extremely slow due to the continuous growth of the graph and the loss of sparsity. Both problems can be addressed by a graph pruning algorithm. It carefully removes vertices and edges to keep the graph size reasonable while preserving the information needed to provide good SLAM results. We propose a novel method that considers geometric criteria for choosing the vertices to be pruned. It is efficient, easy to implement, and leads to a graph with evenly spread vertices that remain part of the robot trajectory. Furthermore, we present a novel approach of marginalization that is more robust to wrong loop closures than existing methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two publicly available real-world long-term datasets and compared to the unpruned case as well as ground truth. We show that even on a long dataset (25h), our approach manages to keep the graph sparse and the speed high while still providing good accuracy (40 times speed up, 6cm map error compared to unpruned case).",,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636530,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Costs;Density functional theory;Trajectory;Standards;Intelligent robots,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

As a basis for a localization system we propose a complete on-board mapping pipeline able to map robust meaningful landmarks, such as poles from power lines, in the vicinity of the vehicle. Such poles are good candidates for reliable and long term landmarks even through difficult weather conditions or seasonal changes. To address the challenges of motion blur and illumination changes in railway scenarios we employ a Dynamic Vision Sensor, a novel event-based camera. Using a sideways oriented on-board camera, poles appear as vertical lines. To map such lines in a real-time event stream, we introduce Hough2Map, a novel consecutive iterative event-based Hough transform framework capable of detecting, tracking, and triangulating close-by structures. We demonstrate the mapping reliability and accuracy of Hough2Map on real-world data in typical usage scenarios and evaluate using surveyed infrastructure ground truth maps.

Huang,IEEE Access,2020,IEEE Abstract,20401--20412,8,"A globally consistent map is the basis of indoor robot localization and navigation. However, map built by Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) doesnt have high global consistency which is not suitable for long-term application in large scene. To address the problem, we present an improved RBPF Lidar SLAM system with loop detection and correction named LCPF. The efficiency and accuracy of loop detection depend on the segmentation of submaps. Instead of dividing the submap at fixed number of laser scan like existing method, Dynamic Submap Segmentation is proposed in LCPF. This segmentation algorithm decreases the error inside the submap by splitting the submap where there is high scan match error and later rectifies the error by an improved pose graph optimization between submaps. In order to segment the submap at appropriate point, when to create a new submap is determined by both the accumulation of scan match error and the particle distribution. Furthermore, LCPF uses branch and bound algorithm as basic detector for loop detection and multiple criteria to judge the reliability of a loop. In the criteria, a novel parameter called usable ratio was proposed to measure the useful information that a laser scan containing. Finally, comparisons to existing 2D-Lidar mapping algorithm are performed with a series of open dataset simulations and real robot experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of LCPF.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968353,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Lasers;Laser radar;Particle filters;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;mobile robots;indoor navigation;particle filter;loop detection;dynamic submap segementation,,2169-3536,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

As the component provides a static mapping to feature vectors, it requires no setup or learning phase and is well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios where input distributions can be nonstationary. Experiments with an actual robot system are presented and results show that the extracted feature vectors manage to capture structures in the environment.

VO has reached a maturity that has allowed us to successfully use it for certain classes of applications: space, ground, aerial, and underwater. In the presence of loop closures, VO can be used as a building block for a complete SLAM algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for VO to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved.

Wu,,2019,IEEE Index Terms,3781--3786,,"Place recognition as one of the most significant requirements for long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been developed rapidly in recent years. Also, deep learning is proved to be more capable than traditional methods to extract features under some complex environments. However, in real-world environments, there are many challenging problems such as viewpoint changes and illumination changes. The existing deep learning-based place recognition in extracting feature phases and matching process is both time-consuming. Moreover, features extracted from convolution neural network (CNN) are floating-point type with high dimension. In this paper, we propose deep supervised hashing for place recognition, where we design a similar hierarchy loss function to learn a model. The model can distinguish the similar images more accurately which is well suitable to place recognition. Besides the model can learn high quality hash codes by maximizing the likelihood of triplet labels. Experiments on several benchmark datasets for place recognition show that our approach is robust to viewpoints, illuminations and season changes with high accuracy.

,Map updating in dynamic environments,F. Abrate and B. Bona and M. Indri and S. Rosa and F. Tibaldi,,2010,IEEE Abstract,1--8,,"While building maps when robot poses are known is a tractable problem requiring limited computational complexity, the simultaneous estimation of the trajectory and the map of the environment (known as SLAM) is much more complex and requires many computational resources. Moreover, SLAM is generally peformed in environments that do not vary over time (called static environments), whereas real applications commonly require navigation services in changing environments (called dynamic environments). Many real robotic applications require updated maps of the environment that vary over time, starting from a given known initial condition. In this context classical SLAM approaches are generally not directly applicable: such approaches only apply in static environments or in dynamic environments where it is possible to model the environment dynamics. We are interested here in long-term mapping operativity in presence of variations in the map, as in the case of robotic applications in logistic spaces, where rovers have to track the presence of goods in given areas.

In this paper, we exploit recent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is assigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the problem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.), Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time.",,10.1109/ICRA.2018.8463150,,,,Semantics;Cameras;Roads;Image segmentation;Visualization;Robustness;Feature extraction,,2577-087X,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Motivated by the large negative effect of ambient noise sources on robot audition, the long-term goal is to provide awareness of the auditory scene to a robot, so that it may more effectively act to filter out the interference or re-position itself to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we concentrate on the discovery of new sources of sound through the use of mobility and directed investigation. This is performed in a two-step process. In the first step, a mobile robot first explores the surrounding acoustical environment, creating evidence grid representations to localize the most influential sound sources in the auditory scene. Then in the second step, the robot investigates each potential sound source location in the environment so as to improve the localization result, and identify volume and directionality characteristics of the sound source. Once every source has been investigated, a noise map of the entire auditory scene is created for use by the robot in avoiding areas of loud ambient noise when performing an auditory task.",,10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363825,,,,Layout;Acoustic noise;Robotics and automation;Working environment noise;Mobile robots;Microphone arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Filters;Interference;Position measurement;Sound Source Localization;Evidence Grid;Mobile Robots;Sound Mapping,,1050-4729,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Approximating Marginalization with Sparse Global Priors for Sliding Window SLAM-Graphs,D. Wilbers and L. Rumberg and C. Stachniss,,2019,IEEE Abstract,25--31,,"Most autonomous vehicles rely on some kind of map for localization or navigation. Outdated maps however are a risk to the performance of any map-based localization system applied in autonomous vehicles. It is necessary to update the used maps to ensure stable and long-term operation. We address the problem of computing landmark updates live in the vehicle, which requires efficient use of the computational resources. In particular, we employ a graph-based sliding window approach for simultaneous localization and incremental map refinement. We propose a novel method that approximates sliding window marginalization without inducing fill-in. Our method maintains the exact same sparsity pattern as without performing marginalization, but simultaneously improves the landmark estimates. The main novelty of this work is the derivation of sparse global priors that approximate dense marginalization. In comparison to state-of-the-art work, our approach utilizes global instead of local linearization points, but still minimizes linearization errors. We first approximate marginalization via Kullback-Leibler divergence and then recalculate the mean to compensate linearization errors.

The ability to exchange map information is an essential requirement for collaborative exploration. When moving to large-scale environments, where the communication data rate between the swarm participants is typically limited, efficient compression algorithms and an approach for discarding less informative parts of the map are key for a successful long-term operation. In this paper, we present a novel compression approach for environment maps obtained from a visual SLAM system. We apply feature coding to the visual information to compress the map efficiently. We make use of a minimum spanning tree to connect all features that serve as observations of a single map point. Thereby, we can exploit inter-feature dependencies and obtain an optimal coding order. Additionally, we add a map sparsification step to keep only useful map points by solving a linear integer programming problem, which preserves the map points that exhibit both good compression properties and high observability.

Hu,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2020,IEEE Abstract,1555--1565,25,"This article investigates long-term positioning of moving objects by monocular vision of a miniature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. It is challenging to perform a real-time onboard vision processing task, due to the strict payload capacity and power budget limitations of microflying vehicles. We propose a parallel onboard architecture that explicitly decouples the long-term positioning task into iteratively operated detection, tracking, and localization. The proposed approach is eventually called onboard detection-tracking-localization, namely oDTL. The detector automatically extracts and identifies the object from image frames captured at in-flight durations. A learning-based network is constructed to improve detection accuracy and robustness against ever-changing outdoor illumination conditions and flying viewpoints. The tracker follows the object within specified region-of-interest from frame to frame with lower computing consumption. To further reduce target-losing rate, a concept of blind zone is proposed and applied, and its boundaries in sequential images are also theoretically inferred. The position estimator maps the flying vehicle pose, the image coordinates, and calibration specifications into real-world positions of the moving target. An extended Kalman filter is developed for rough position estimation, and a smooth module is introduced for the refinement of the position.

A three-layered selective audio ray tracing mechanism is proposed in this work. The first layer conducts frame-based unreliable ray rejection (sensory rejection) considering sound reflection and wall occlusion. The second layer introduces triangulation and audio tracing to detect falsely detected sound sources, rejecting audio rays associated to these misdetected sounds sources (short-term rejection). A third layer is tasked with rejecting rays using the whole history (long-term rejection) to disambiguate sound occlusion.

The robot must interact with the map on time, updating its location to build a further route to explore areas that have not been visited.

Kodagoda,,2011,IEEE Abstract,2969--2974,,"WITU (Wearable Indoor Tracking Unit) is a wearable robotic device that aids indoor navigation by building maps and localizing the user within them. Applications of such a device include search and rescue, travel aid in large and complex buildings, museum guides among others where external localization information such as from a GPS is not available. However, WITU relies on human intelligence both to maintain long term consistency of its location estimates and to efficiently manage its limited memory and processing capacity. This alludes to a symbiotic relationship between the user and the device and here we look at this symbiotic relationship from an end user perspective. Thus, in order to have a successful interaction, we argue that the user needs to feel comfortable wearing the device while carrying out the intended tasks. We hypothesize that this perceived comfort is dependent on the context in which the device is used. We test our hypothesis on three different scenarios; search and rescue worker, dementia patient in a long care facility and a person at a party which acts as the baseline.

Weikersdorfer,,2020,IEEE Abstract,2317--2323,,"Accurate and robust global localization is essential to robotics applications. We propose a novel global localization method that employs the map traversability as a hidden observation. The resulting map-corrected odometry localization is able to provide an accurate belief tensor of the robot state. Our method can be used for blind robots in dark or highly reflective areas. In contrast to odometry drift in the long-term, our method using only odometry and the map converges in long-term. Our method can also be integrated with other sensors to boost the localization performance. The algorithm does not have any initial state assumption and tracks all possible robot states at all times. Therefore, our method is global and is robust in the event of ambiguous observations. We parallel each step of our algorithm such that it can be performed in real-time (up to ~300 Hz) using GPU. We validate our algorithm in different publicly available floor-plans and show that it is able to converge to the ground truth fast while being robust to ambiguities.",,10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197225,,,,Robot sensing systems;Tensile stress;Trajectory;Robustness;Uncertainty;Real-time systems,,2577-087X,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Miller,IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,2011,IEEE Abstract,946--958,47,"To enable navigation of miniature aerial vehicles (MAVs) with a low-quality inertial measurement unit (IMU), external sensors are typically fused with the information generated by the low-quality IMU. Most commercial systems for MAVs currently fuse GPS measurements with IMU information to navigate the MAV. However there are many scenarios in which an MAV might prove useful, but GPS is not available (e.g., indoors, urban terrain, etc.). Therefore several approaches have recently been introduced that couple information from an IMU with visual information (usually captured by an electro-optical camera). In general the methods for fusing visual information with an IMU utilizes one of two techniques: 1) applying rigid body constraints on where landmarks should appear in a set of two images (constraint-based fusion) or 2) simultaneously estimating the location of features that are observed by the camera (mapping) and the location of the camera (simultaneous localization and mapping-SLAM-based fusion). While each technique has some nuances associated with its implementation in a true MAV environment (i.e., computational requirements, real-time implementation, feature tracking, etc.), this paper focuses solely on answering the question ""Which fusion technique (constraint- or SLAM-based) enables more accurate long-term MAV navigation?"" To answer this question, specific implementations of a constraint- and SLAM-based fusion technique, with novel modifications for improved results on MAVs, are described. A basic simulation environment is used to perform a comparison of the constraint- and SLAM-based fusion methods.

Jo,IEEE Access,2021,IEEE Abstract,470--484,9,"Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors enable a vehicle to estimate a pose by matching their measurements with a point cloud (PCD) map. However, the PCD map structure, widely used in robot fields, has some problems to be applied for mass production in automotive fields. First, the PCD map is too big to store all map data at in-vehicle units or download the map data from a wireless network according to the vehicle location. Second, the PCD map, represented by a single origin in the Cartesian coordinates, causes coordinate conversion errors due to an inaccurate plane-orb projection, when the vehicle estimate the geodetic pose on Earth. To solve two problems, this paper presents a geodetic normal distribution (GND) map structure. The GND map structure supports a geodetic quad-tree tiling system with multiple origins to minimize the coordinate conversion errors. The map data managed by the GND map structure are compressed by using Cartesian probabilistic distributions of points as map features. The truncation errors by heterogeneous coordinates between the geodetic tiling system and Cartesian distributions are compensated by the Cartesian voxelization rule. In order to match the LiDAR measurements with the GND map structure, the paper proposes map-matching approaches based on Monte-Carlo and optimization.

However, real-world experiments are extremely challenging and limited for extraterrestrial environment.

Bekris,,2021,IEEE Abstract,8067--8074,,"Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot manipulation. Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed methods reduced information requirements.

This paper presents a novel solution for long-term monocular VI SLAM system in dynamic environment based on autoregression(AR) modeling and map prediction. Map points are first classified into static and semi-static map points according to a memory model. Modeling and prediction of the different states of semi-static map points are performed that are derived from time series models. The predicted map is then fused with the current map to achieve a better forecast for the next frame if the prediction is not satisfactory enough. Experiments are carried out on an embedded system.

For fully autonomous systems, the robot would further need to actively plan its paths during exploration. The problem of designing robot trajectories to actively explore an unknown environment and minimize the map error is referred to as active simultaneous localization and mapping (active SLAM). Existing work has focused on planning paths with occupancy grid maps, which do not scale well and suffer from long term drift. This work proposes a Topological Feature Graph (TFG) representation that scales well and develops an active SLAM algorithm with it. The TFG uses graphical models, which utilize independences between variables, and enables a unified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single entropy metric. Hence, it facilitates a natural and principled balance between map exploration and refinement. A probabilistic roadmap path-planner is used to generate robot paths in real time.

DynaSLAM is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D configurations. We are capable of detecting the moving objects either by multiview geometry, deep learning, or both.

Many previous approaches to mapping assume a static world. In this work we incorporate the time dimension into the mapping process to enable a robot to maintain an accurate map while operating in dynamical environments. This paper presents Dynamic Pose Graph SLAM (DPG-SLAM), an algorithm designed to enable a robot to remain localized in an environment that changes substantially over time. Using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) as the underlying SLAM state estimation engine, the Dynamic Pose Graph evolves over time as the robot explores new places and revisits previously mapped areas. The approach has been implemented for planar indoor environments, using laser scan matching to derive constraints for SLAM state estimation. Laser scans for the same portion of the environment at different times are compared to perform change detection; when sufficient change has occurred in a location, the dynamic pose graph is edited to remove old poses and scans that no longer match the current state of the world. Experimental results are shown for two real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets, demonstrating the ability to maintain an up-to-date map despite long-term environmental changes.",,10.1109/IROS.2012.6385561,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Measurement by laser beam;Mobile robots;Heuristic algorithms;Lasers,,2153-0866,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Enabling persistent autonomy for underwater gliders through terrain based navigation,A. Stuntz and D. Liebel and R. N. Smith,,2015,IEEE Abstract,1--10,,"To effectively examine ocean processes we must often sample over the duration of long (weeks to months) oscillation patterns. Such sampling requires persistent autonomous underwater vehicles, that have a similarly long deployment duration. Actively actuated (propeller-driven) underwater vehicles have proven effective in multiple sampling scenarios, however they have limited deployment endurance. The emergence of less actuated vehicles, i.e., underwater gliders, has enabled greater energy savings and thus increased endurance. Due to reduced actuation, these vehicles are more susceptible to external forces, e.g., ocean currents, causing them to have poor navigational and localization accuracy underwater. This is exacerbated in coastal regions, where current velocities are the same order of magnitude as the vehicle velocity. In this paper, we examine a method of reducing navigation and localization error, not only for navigation, but more so for more accurately reconstructing the path that the glider traversed to contextualize the gathered data, with respect to the science question at hand. We present a set of algorithms for offline processing that accurately localizes the traversed path of an underwater glider over long-term, ocean deployments.

Richardt,,2021,IEEE Abstract,2866--2875,,"Visual camera localization using offline maps is widespread in robotics and mobile applications. Most state-of-the-art localization approaches assume static scenes, so maps are often reconstructed once and then kept constant. However, many scenes are dynamic and as changes in the scene happen, future localization attempts may struggle or fail entirely. Therefore, it is important for successful long-term localization to update and maintain maps as new observations of the scene, and changes in it, arrive. We propose a novel method for automatically discovering which points in a map remain stable over time, and which are due to transient changes. To this end, we calculate a stability store for each point based on its visibility over time, weighted by an exponential decay over time. This allows us to consider the impact of time when scoring points, and to distinguish which points are useful for long-term localization. We evaluate our method on the CMU Extended Seasons dataset (outdoors) and a new indoor dataset of a retail shop, and show the benefit of maintaining a `live map' that integrates updates over time using our exponential decay based method over a static `base map'.",,10.1109/WACV48630.2021.00291,,,,Location awareness;Visualization;Computer vision;Conferences;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Mobile applications,,2642-9381,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Taghirad,,2015,IEEE Abstract,511--516,,"In the problem of simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) for a mobile robot, it is required to detect previously visited locations so the estimation error shall be reduced. Sensor observations are compared by a similarity metric to detect loops. In long term navigation or exploration, the number of observations increases and so the complexity of the loop closure detection. Several techniques are proposed in order to reduce the complexity of loop closure detection. Few algorithms have considered the loop closure detection from a subset of sensor observations. In this paper, the compressed sensing approach is exploited to detect loops from few sensor measurements. In the basic compressed sensing it is assumed that a signal has a sparse representation is a basis which means that only a few elements of the signal are non-zero. Based on the compressed sensing approach a sparse signal can be recovered from few linear noisy projections by l1 minimization. The difference matrix which is widely used for loop detection has a sparse structure, where similar observations are shown by zero distance and different locations are indicated by ones. Based on the multiple measurement vector technique which is an extension of the basic compressed sensing, the loop closure detection is performed by comparison of few sensor observations.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of active vision for localizing objects that are too large to fall within a single camerapsilas field of view and show that well-calibrated vision-based sensors are sufficient to safely pass through a door frame that is narrow enough to tolerate a wheelchair localization error of at most a few centimetres.

,Recurrent-OctoMap: Learning State-Based Map Refinement for Long-Term Semantic Mapping With 3-D-Lidar Data,L. Sun and Z. Yan and A. Zaganidis and C. Zhao and T. Duckett,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2018,IEEE Index Terms,3749--3756,3,"This letter presents a novel semantic mapping approach, Recurrent-OctoMap, learned from long-term three-dimensional (3-D) Lidar data. Most existing semantic mapping approaches focus on improving semantic understanding of single frames, rather than 3-D refinement of semantic maps (i.e. fusing semantic observations). The most widely used approach for the 3-D semantic map refinement is Bayes update, which fuses the consecutive predictive probabilities following a Markov-chain model. Instead, we propose a learning approach to fuse the semantic features, rather than simply fusing predictions from a classifier. In our approach, we represent and maintain our 3-D map as an OctoMap, and model each cell as a recurrent neural network, to obtain a Recurrent-OctoMap. In this case, the semantic mapping process can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence encoding-decoding problem. Moreover, in order to extend the duration of observations in our Recurrent-OctoMap, we developed a robust 3-D localization and mapping system for successively mapping a dynamic environment using more than two weeks of data, and the system can be trained and deployed with arbitrary memory length. We validate our approach on the ETH long-term 3-D Lidar dataset.

Further, we propose a novel type of prior, called motion prior, to predict the relative motions of stationary objects and anomaly ego-motion detection. The proposed prior is also useful for distinguishing stationary from non-stationary objects.

The edges connecting the nodes indicate that these nodes represent the same landmark or place, even though places and landmarks encoded by the nodes may exhibit different appearances in the long-term periods. Then, a graph embedding is learned to preserve the locality in the feature descriptor space, i.e., finding a projection such that the same landmark and place have the identical representation in the new projected descriptor space, no matter in what scenarios they are recorded.

Different from most of the existing place recognition methods using pure vision, this article studies light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based approaches.

On the other hand, they are dramatically affected by structural changes from different viewpoints or across seasons. In this article, a novel LiDAR-based place recognition system is proposed to achieve long-term robust localization, even under severe seasonal changes and viewpoint shifts. To improve the efficiency, a compact cylindrical image model is designed to convert three-dimensional point clouds to two-dimensional images representing the prominent geometric relationships of scenes. The contexts (buildings, trees, road structures, etc.) of scenes are utilized for efficient place recognition. A sequence-based temporal consistency check is also introduced for postverification.

In many scenarios, image sequences are available and existing work on combining single-image localization with odometry offers to unlock their potential for improving localization performance. Still, the largest part of the literature focuses on single-image localization and ignores the availability of sequence data. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of image sequences in challenging scenarios, e.g., under day-night or seasonal changes. Combining ideas from the literature, we describe a sequence-based localization pipeline that combines odometry with both a coarse and a fine localization module. Experiments on long-term localization datasets show that combining single-image global localization against a prebuilt map with a visual odometry/SLAM pipeline improves performance to a level where the extended CMU Seasons dataset can be considered solved.

It only maps these features in a vocabulary list by a localization module to tackle the optical flow drift and the lose of the navigation estimation. That module, based on the well established algorithm DBoW2, will be also used to close the loop and allow long-term navigation in previously visited areas. The combination of high speed optical flow navigation with a low rate localization algorithm allows fully autonomous navigation for MAV, at the same time it reduces the overall computational load.

Leonard,,2016,IEEE Index Terms,1063--1070,,"The feature-based graphical approach to robotic mapping provides a representationally rich and computationally efficient framework for an autonomous agent to learn a model of its environment. However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, everything changes and nothing stands still,  and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment.

The main problem we face is how to obtain discriminative and compact visual landmarks, which are necessary to cope with changes in appearance in an environment and with a large amount of visual information. We address this issue by proposing the use of common object patterns, which are inherent in typical environments (e.g., indoor, street, forests, suburban, etc.), as visual landmarks for a SLAM-PCE task. In our contributions, we describe our approach, part-based SLAM, and validate its effectiveness within a standard problem of view image retrieval. The main novelty of this approach lies in that the common landmark objects are extracted in an unsupervised manner via common pattern discovery, and can be used for compact characterization and efficient retrieval of view images. Our method is also innovative in its use of traditional bounding box-based part annotation: an image is represented in a compact form, bag-of-bounding-boxes (BoBB) and then, the scene matching can be solved efficiently as a low dimensional problem of matching bounding boxes.

Jia,,2021,IEEE Index Terms,782--787,,"Robots can perform various missions in multiple changing environments. The dynamic objects have significant influence on the long-term autonomy and 3D map construction, because ghost tracks inevitably exist due to the continuous error-accumulation of the input data. So it is critical to keep only static subsets and exclude noisy obstacles to mitigate the influence on mapping and navigation. We propose a robust static map building method, which compares the discrepancies between single scan data against the noisy map. This method focuses on the advantages of most dynamic objects of different views with unique attribution and will be easily detected in these views. Accordingly, we present the novel Multi-View and Multi-Resolution image-based method with BEV-RV (Bird's Eye View-Range View) modules to discriminate static/dynamic point clouds. Through two stages of iteration with different image window sizes of point level, we first collect more static points of some inevitably wrong judgments and then remove such completely unreliable dynamic points at a later stage.

With the observation that road vehicles tend to perform smooth dynamic characteristics in most of the time, we design the inertia loss function to describe the abnormal motion variation, which assists the model to learn the consecutiveness from long-term camera ego-motion. Based on the recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture, our method implicitly models the dynamics of road vehicles and the temporal consecutiveness by the extended Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) block. Furthermore, we develop the dynamic hard-edge mask to handle the non-consistency in fast camera motion by blocking the boundary part and which generates more efficiency in the whole non-consistency mask.

The long-term unreliable keyframe linking with large uncertainty of GPS which called GPS-restricted or GPS-denied situation will cause the drift when mapping. To eliminate the drift, in contrast to use the closed-loop detection and global optimization which will increase the computational burden extremely with the size of the map enlarged, a semi-global optimization method is proposed to relieve the burden, which make the localization estimated by this method possible to be used to navigate for unmanned vehicles. In our method, the confidence of the GPS signal is significantly important, however, the covariance supplied by the GPS receiver may not be trustworthy sometimes, which cause some unnecessary mistake when optimizing, thus a semi-supervised clustering method taking the information of GPS and IMU into account synthetically is introduced to get that confidence more robustly.",,10.1109/WCICA.2018.8630513,,,,Global Positioning System;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Cameras;Receivers;Real-time systems;Fuses,,,,,,44698.62117,44698.62117,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,I am Not Afraid of the GPS Jammer: Resilient Navigation via Signals of Opportunity in GPS-Denied Environments,Z. Z. Kassas and J. Khalife and A. Abdallah and C. Lee,IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine,2022,IEEE Abstract,1--1,,"In environments where GPS signals are denied, signals of opportunity (SOPs) could serve as an alternative positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) source to GPS, and more generally, to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). This paper presents a radio simultaneous localization and mapping (radio SLAM) approach that enables the exploitation of SOPs for resilient and accurate PNT. Radio SLAM estimates the states of the navigator-mounted receiver simultaneously with the SOPs states. This paper presents the first published experimental results evaluating the efficacy of radio SLAM in a real GPS-denied environment. These experiments took place at Edwards Air Force Base, California, USA, during which GPS was intentionally jammed with jamming-to-signal (J/S) ratio as high as 90 dB. The paper evaluates the timing of two cellular long-term evolution (LTE) SOPs located in the jammed environment. Moreover, the paper presents navigation results showcasing a ground vehicle traversing a trajectory of about 5 km in 180 seconds in the GPS-jammed environment. The vehicles GPS-IMU system drifted from the vehicles ground truth trajectory, resulting in a position root mean-squared error (RMSE) of 238 m.

Liu,,2021,IEEE Abstract,998--1003,,"Localization on 3D data is a challenging task for unmanned vehicles, especially in long-term dynamic urban scenarios. Due to the generality and long-term stability, the pole-like objects are very suitable as landmarks for unmanned vehicle localization in time-varying scenarios. In this paper, a long-term LiDAR-only localization algorithm based on semantic cluster map is proposed. At first, the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used to infer the semantics of LiDAR point clouds. Combined with the point cloud segmentation, the static objects pole/trunk are extracted and registered into global semantic cluster map. When the unmanned vehicle re-enters the environment again, the relocalization is completed by matching the clusters of current scan with the clusters of the global map. Furthermore, the matching between the local and global maps stably outputs the global pose at 2Hz to correct the drift of the 3D LiDAR odometry. The experimental results on our campus dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in localization accuracy compared with the current state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel AUV localization method taking advantage of the recent progress in ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). During navigation, the AUV performs intermittent local background flow velocity measurements or estimates using on-board sensors. A series of preloaded flow velocity forecast maps generated by OGCMs are referred by a particle filter in updating particle weights based on resemblance between forecasts and local estimation. A rigorous derivation of the problem in probability theory is presented to reveal the recursive structure of the target distribution function. Simulations in a simple double-gyre velocity field exhibit satisfactory converging localization error. Further simulations in a flow field with local flow fluctuations that are not resolved by OGCMs show similar convergent localization error with a slower converging rate. As a first step towards a new set of underwater localization methods, this work presents promising results and reveals the possibility of realizing converging global underwater localization through partial utilization of the background flow information that is easily accessible.",,10.1109/CDC.2014.7040480,,,,Oceans;Vehicles;Velocity measurement;Vectors;Navigation;Robots;Sensors,,0191-2216,,,,44698.62117,44698.62117,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Dantu,,2017,IEEE Abstract,526--531,,"Building and storing efficient maps is an essential feature for long-term autonomy of robots. Modern sensors (such as Kinect) tend to produce a lot of data. However, long-term autonomy requires us to store this information in a succinct manner. One way to reduce dimensionality of information is to attribute semantics. Most indoor objects are cuboidal in nature. We conjecture that cuboids are a suitable semantic feature to attribute to indoor objects for efficient mapping. We adapt a cuboid fitting algorithm previously proposedfor object recognition, for indoor mapping. Our work stems from the observation that landmark detection for mappingrequires consistent detection of those landmarks. We implement several modifications to this cuboid detection algorithm that lead to consistent detection such as emptiness, orientation, surface coverage, distance from edges, and others. We incorporate these in the identification of the cuboid candidates in a scene, as well as an optimization algorithm for finding the best set of consistent cubes to cover a given scene. Our experiments show that in comparison, the set of cuboids detected by our algorithm are at least 50% more consistent based on our metrics.SLAM.",,10.1109/ICSC.2017.78,,,,Image segmentation;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Semantics;Object recognition;Image edge detection;Optimization;Image color analysis,,,,,,44698.62117,44698.62117,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

It is a fundamental kernel that enables head-mounted augmented/virtual reality devices and autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles. A noticeable recent trend in visual SLAM is to apply computationand memory-intensive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that outperform traditional hand-designed feature-based methods [1]. For each video frame, CNN-extracted features are matched with stored keypoints to estimate the agent's 6-DoF pose by solving a perspective-n-points (PnP) non-linear optimization problem (Fig. 7.3.1, left). The agent's long-term trajectory over multiple frames is refined by a bundle adjustment process (BA, Fig. 7.3.1 right), which involves a large-scale (~120 variables) non-linear optimization. Visual SLAM requires massive computation (>250GOP/s) in the CNN-based feature extraction and matching, as well as datadependent dynamic memory access and control flow with high-precision operations, creating significant low-power design challenges. Software implementations are impractical, resulting in 0.2s runtime with a ~3GHz CPU+ GPU system with >100MB memory footprint and >100W power consumption.

Ye,,2022,IEEE Abstract,685--689,,"In recent years, robots have been widely used in the service industry to improve work efficiency. An indoor service robot should have long-term autonomous adaptability and this is achieved by performing lifelong simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, when a robot wakes up to SLAM, it needs to relocate itself first. In real-world applications, the visual ambiguous environment which contains multiple locations with similar appearances or features is a challenging scenario for localization. Considering the insufficient expression ability of a single sensor, this paper proposes a bio-inspired relocalization method to deal with this problem. The local view cells model maintains multi-hypotheses to provide visual-based coarse relocalization. Then, an obstacle cell model converts the self-centered lidar information into allocentric representation. And it serves as the fine relocalization. A continuous attractor neural network (CANN) is applied to integrate the candidates obtained through the above two stages. Finally, the result of relocalization is selected by a double-checking mechanism. In the experiments, the success rate of the proposed method reaches 95 % in total and 75% in the most challenging scene.

This problem is called place recognition. In recent years, LiDAR scan based place recognition has drawn attention as it is robust against the appearance change. In this letter, we propose a LiDAR-based place recognition method, named Differentiable Scan Context with Orientation (DiSCO), which simultaneously finds the scan at a similar place and estimates their relative orientation. The orientation can further be used as the initial value for the down-stream local optimal metric pose estimation, improving the pose estimation especially when a large orientation between the current scan and retrieved scan exists. Our key idea is to transform the feature into the frequency domain. We utilize the magnitude of the spectrum as the place descriptor, which is theoretically rotation-invariant. In addition, based on the differentiable phase correlation, we can efficiently estimate the global optimal relative orientation using the spectrum. With such structural constraints, the network can be learned in an end-to-end manner, and the backbone is fully shared by the two tasks, achieving better interpretability and lightweight.

While Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most fundamental problems for robotic autonomy, most existing SLAM works are evaluated with data sequences that are recorded in a short period of time. In real-world deployment, there can be out-of-sight scene changes caused by both natural factors and human activities. For example, in home scenarios, most objects may be movable, replaceable or deformable, and the visual features of the same place may be significantly different in some successive days. Such out-of-sight dynamics pose great challenges to the robustness of pose estimation, and hence a robots long-term deployment and operation. To differentiate the forementioned problem from the conventional works which are usually evaluated in a static setting in a single run, the term lifelong SLAM is used here to address SLAM problems in an ever-changing environment over a long period of time.

To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo camera based visual localization method using a modified laser map, which takes the advantage of both the low cost of camera, and high geometric precision of laser data to achieve long-term performance. Considering that LiDAR and camera give measurements of the same environment in different modalities, the cross-modal invariance is investigated to modify the laser map for visual localization. Specifically, a map learning algorithm is introduced to sample the robust subsets in laser maps that are useful for visual localization using multi-session visual and laser data. Further, a generative map model is derived to describe this cross-modal invariance, based on which two types of measurements are defined to model the laser map points as appropriate visual observations. Tightly coupling these measurements within the local bundle adjustment during online sliding-window based visual odometry, the vehicle can achieve robust localization even one year after the map was built. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both the public KITTI datasets and self-collected datasets in our campus, which include seasonal, illumination and object variations.

Long-term visual localization in real time is particularly challenging, in which the robot is required to efficiently localize itself using visual data where appearance may change significantly over time. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based visual localization system targeting at long-term localization in real time. On the robot, we employ two estimators to achieve accurate and real-time performance. One is a sliding-window based visual inertial odometry, which integrates constraints from consecutive observations and self-motion measurements, as well as the constraints induced by localization results from the cloud. This estimator builds a local visual submap as the virtual observation which is then sent to the cloud as new localization constraints. The other one is a delayed state Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the pose of the robot localized from the cloud, the local odometry and the high-frequency inertial measurements. On the cloud, we propose a longer sliding-window based localization method to aggregate the virtual observations for larger field of view, leading to more robust alignment between virtual observations and the map. Under this architecture, the robot can achieve drift-free and real-time localization using onboard resources even in a network with limited bandwidth, high latency and existence of package loss, which enables the autonomous navigation in real-world environment.

Although the atomic steps involved in constructing a vision front end are well-known, many of the popular choices of the features and their parameters do not perform reliably in a variety of visually degraded underwater and polar environments that are characterized by low texture and contrast, and by unevenly lit and low-overlap imagery. In this paper, we develop novel metrics and quantitative analysis methods which can measure the impact of image pre-processing steps such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) on the improvement of vision front-end outputs. Our metrics and quantitative analysis can guide the selection between different feature detectors and descriptors to develop a reliable and robust vision front end that can operate in a wider range of underwater and polar environments.

During navigation, the localization method can classify observation corresponding to static and non-static objects respectively and evaluate whether those semi-dynamic objects have moved, to reduce the weight of invalid observation and localization fluctuation.

Localizing such low-power backscatter tags is crucial for IoT-based smart services. However, current backscatter localization systems require prior knowledge of the site, either a map or landmarks with known positions, increasing the deployment cost. To empower universal localization service, this paper presents Rover, an indoor localization system that simultaneously localizes multiple backscatter tags with zero start-up cost using a robot equipped with inertial sensors. Rover runs in a joint optimization framework, fusing WiFi-based positioning measurements with inertial measurements to simultaneously estimate the locations of both the robot and the connected tags. Our design addresses practical issues such as the interference among multiple tags and the real- time processing for solving the SLAM problem.

While dense 3D point-cloud-based maps enable precise localization, they impose significant storage and transmission burdens when used in city-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a highly compressed representation for LiDAR maps, along with an efficient and robust real-time alignment algorithm for on-vehicle LiDAR scans. The proposed mapping framework, which we refer to as Feature Likelihood Acquisition Map Emulation (FLAME), requires less than 0.1% of the storage space of the original 3D point cloud map. In essence, FLAME emulates an original map through feature likelihood functions. In particular, FLAME models planar, pole and curb features. These three feature classes are long-term stable, distinct and common among vehicular roadways. Multiclass feature points are extracted from LiDAR scans through feature detection. A new multiclass-based point-to-distribution alignment method is proposed to find the association and alignment between the multiclass feature points and the FLAME map.

Biswas,,2016,IEEE Abstract,4643--4648,,"Autonomous service mobile robots need to consistently, accurately, and robustly localize in human environments despite changes to such environments over time. Episodic non-Markov Localization addresses the challenge of localization in such changing environments by classifying observations as arising from Long-Term, Short-Term, or Dynamic Features. However, in order to do so, EnML relies on an estimate of the Long-Term Vector Map (LTVM) that does not change over time. In this paper, we introduce a recursive algorithm to build and update the LTVM over time by reasoning about visibility constraints of objects observed over multiple robot deployments. We use a signed distance function (SDF) to filter out observations of short-term and dynamic features from multiple deployments of the robot. The remaining long-term observations are used to build a vector map by robust local linear regression. The uncertainty in the resulting LTVM is computed via Monte Carlo resampling the observations arising from long-term features. By combining occupancy-grid based SDF filtering of observations with continuous space regression of the filtered observations, our proposed approach builds, updates, and amends LTVMs over time, reasoning about all observations from all robot deployments in an environment.

Adamy,,2018,IEEE Abstract,2645--2652,,"The precise localization of vehicles is an important requirement for autonomous driving or advanced driver assistance systems. Using common GNSS the ego position can be measured but not with the reliability and precision necessary. An alternative approach to achieve precise localization is the usage of visual landmarks observed by a camera mounted in the vehicle. However, this raises the necessity of reliable visual landmarks that are easily recognizable and persistent. We propose a novel SLAM algorithm that focuses on learning and mapping such visual long-term landmarks (LLamas). The algorithm therefore processes stereo image streams from several recording sessions in the same spatial area. The key part within LLama-SLAM is the assessment of the landmarks with quality values that are inferred as viewpoint dependent probabilities from observation statistics. By adding solely landmarks of high quality to the final LLama Map, it can be kept compact while still allowing reliable localization. Due to the long-term evaluation of the GNSS measurement during the sessions, the landmarks can be positioned precisely in a global referenced coordinate system. For a first assessment of the algorithm's capabilities, we present some experimental results from the mapping process combining three sessions recorded over two months on the same route.",,10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569323,,,,Cameras;Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Global navigation satellite system;Reliability;Probability;Optimization,,2153-0017,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,6 DoF SLAM using a ToF camera: The challenge of a continuously growing number of landmarks,S. Hochdorfer and C. Schlegel,,2010,IEEE Abstract,3981--3986,,"Localization and mapping are fundamental problems in service robotics since representations of the environment and knowledge about the own pose significantly simplify the implementation of a series of high-level applications. ToF (time-of-flight) cameras are a relatively new kind of sensors in robotics. They enable the real-time capture of the distance and the grayscale information of a scene. Due to the increase of the image resolution of ToF cameras, now highlevel computer vision algorithms for visual feature extraction (e.g. SIFT or SURF) can be applied to the captured images. These visual features combined with the corresponding distance information give a full measurement of 3D landmarks. An obvious problem to be solved is the continuously growing number of landmarks. So far, all ever seen landmarks are just accumulated irrespective of their utility and the then required resources. Rather, one should keep only really useful landmarks, e.g. such that localization quality in the whole operational area is kept above a given threshold. In fact a lifelong running SLAM approach is dependent on means to select and discard landmarks. That is even more acute in case of feature-rich sensor data as provided with high update rates by sensors like a ToF camera. We run our SLAM approach in a real-world experiment within an indoor environment.

Moreover, they have to do it at faster speeds than conventional mobile robots. This paper reports on an efficient technique to optimize the position of a sequence of maps along a journey. We take advantage of the short-term precision and reduced space on disk of the localization using 2D occupancy grid maps, from now on called sub-maps, as well as, the long-term global consistency of a Kalman filter that fuses odometry and GPS measurements. In our approach, horizontal planar LiDARs and odometry measurements are used to perform 2D-SLAM generating the sub-maps, and the EKF to generate the trajectory followed by the car in global coordinates. During the trip, after finishing each sub-map, a relaxation process is applied to a set of the last sub-maps to position them globally using both, global and map's local path. The importance of this method lies on its performance, expending low computing resources, so it can work in real time on a computer with conventional characteristics and on its robustness which makes it suitable for being used on a self-driving car as it doesn't depend excessively on the availability of GPS signal or the eventual appearance of moving objects around the car.

Sampling is decisive to the performance of MCL [1]. However, traditional MCL can only sample from a uniform distribution over the state space. Although variants of MCL propose different sampling models, they fail to provide an accurate distribution or generalize across scenes. To better deal with these problems, we present a distribution proposal model named Deep Samplable Observation Model (DSOM). DSOM takes a map and a 2D laser scan as inputs and outputs a conditional multimodal probability distribution of the pose, making the samples more focusing on the regions with higher likelihood. With such samples, the convergence is expected to be more effective and efficient. Considering that the learning-based sampling model may fail to capture the accurate pose sometimes, we furthermore propose the Adaptive Mixture MCL (AdaM MCL), which deploys a trusty mechanism to adaptively select updating mode for each particle to tolerate this situation. Equipped with DSOM, AdaM MCL can achieve more accurate estimation, faster convergence and better scalability than previous methods in both synthetic and real scenes. Even in real environments with long-term changes, AdaM MCL is able to localize the robot using DSOM trained only by simulation observations from a SLAM map or a blueprint map.

Solving this problem is challenging, especially for 3D maps due to the computational complexity. In order to solve this issue, a novel relocalization algorithm based on hierarchical registration is proposed for a known 3D map in this paper. For 3D point cloud maps, the algorithm obtains multi-layer information in the vertical direction through hierarchical registration at the robot's current position. To obtain the best 3D pose for relocalization, we fuse the poses calculated by the multi-layered point cloud into one and use it as the initial pose of the iterative closest point algorithm. The hierarchical registration based algorithm solves the problem of unknown initial value for registration between two large point clouds, improves the recall rate, and ensures the accuracy of algorithm at the same time.

Each robot is equipped with a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and has the ability to communicate with its neighbors. Rather than assuming a known common global frame for all the robots (which is often the case in the literature regarding multi-robot systems), we allow each robot to perform motion estimation locally. For localization, we propose a multi-robot visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) where one robot builds a prior map and then the map is used to bound the long-term drifts of the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) running on the other robots. Moreover, a novel distributed Kalman filter is introduced and employed to cooperatively track the six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion of the object which is represented as a point cloud.

With the explosion of data resulting in increasing runtime of the optimization algorithms ensuring the accuracy of the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) estimates, the large quantity of collected experiences is imposing hard limits on the scalability of such techniques. Considering the keyframe-based paradigm of SLAM techniques, this paper investigates the redundancy inherent in SLAM maps, by quantifying the information of different experiences of the scene as encoded in keyframes.

We present a novel automated crack detection algorithm, the STRUM (spatially tuned robust multifeature) classifier, and demonstrate results on real bridge data using a state-of-the-art robotic bridge scanning system. By using machine learning classification, we eliminate the need for manually tuning threshold parameters. The algorithm uses robust curve fitting to spatially localize potential crack regions even in the presence of noise. Multiple visual features that are spatially tuned to these regions are computed. Feature computation includes examining the scale-space of the local feature in order to represent the information and the unknown salient scale of the crack. The classification results are obtained with real bridge data from hundreds of crack regions over two bridges. This comprehensive analysis shows a peak STRUM classifier performance of 95% compared with 69% accuracy from a more typical image-based approach.

Zhang,,2020,IEEE Index Terms,1070--1076,,"Place recognition is an important component for simultaneously localization and mapping in a variety of robotics applications. Recently, several approaches using landmark information to represent a place showed promising performance to address long-term environment changes. However, previous approaches do not explicitly consider changes of the landmarks, i,e., old landmarks may disappear and new ones often appear over time. In addition, representations used in these approaches to represent landmarks are limited, based upon visual or spatial cues only. In this paper, we introduce a novel worst-case graph matching approach that integrates spatial relationships of landmarks with their appearances for long-term place recognition. Our method designs a graph representation to encode distance and angular spatial relationships as well as visual appearances of landmarks in order to represent a place. Then, we formulate place recognition as a graph matching problem under the worst-case scenario. Our approach matches places by computing the similarities of distance and angular spatial relationships of the landmarks that have the least similar appearances (i.e., worst-case). If the worst appearance similarity of landmarks is small, two places are identified to be not the same, even though their graph representations have high spatial relationship similarities.

Instead, we propose a system for detection of and recovery from severe errors in edge generation. Our system remedies both edges created by view observations and edges created by an odometry motion model. For observation edges, we pair a novel method for monitoring ambiguous views with an intelligent graph-merging algorithm capable of rejecting a relocalization in progress.

,A continuously learning feature-based map using a bernoulli filtering approach,M. Stübler and S. Reuter and K. Dietmayer,,2017,IEEE Index Terms,1--6,,"One of the huge challenges of map-based localization is a rapidly changing environment. The present contribution addresses this problem by first constructing a new framework for feature-based long-term mapping using a Bernoulli filter. This framework is then applied to construct a continuously learning map. It is based on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to create a short-term map which provides a momentary image of the environment during one mapping run. The proposed fusion algorithm then estimates the landmark map on a long-term basis by incorporating those short-term maps. Landmarks in the long-term map that reach a negligible spatial uncertainty can then be used again as a prior for the short-term mapping process. Since a Bernoulli filter can only handle a single object, independent groups of landmarks are constructed where only those with exactly one landmark are updated. As a result, landmarks that are part of the long-term map are quite distinct. By incorporating additional but probably outdated a priori information, the proposed method is able to restrict the inevitable error propagation of SLAM algorithms. The long-term mapping process is further distributable to several agents: every agent simultaneously localizes itself while it generates a new snapshot that is fused into the long-term map afterwards. An evaluation using real-world data completes this contribution.",,10.1109/SDF.2017.8126353,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Markov processes;Time measurement;Mathematical model;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements,,,,,,44698.62163,44698.62163,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

Michaud,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,2013,IEEE Index Terms,734--745,29,"In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop-closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop-closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop-closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a working memory (WM) that is used for loop-closure detection, and transferring the others into a long-term memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations that are stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop-closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard datasets from other appearance-based loop-closure approaches, one custom dataset using real images taken over a 2-km loop of our university campus, and one custom dataset (7 h) using virtual images from the racing video game Need for Speed: Most Wanted.",,10.1109/TRO.2013.2242375,,,,Vocabulary;Feature extraction;Robots;Memory management;Real-time systems;Bayesian methods;Visualization;Appearance-based localization and mapping;bag-of-words approach;dynamic Bayes filtering;place recognition,,1941-0468,,,,44698.62163,44698.62163,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

,SLAM-Loop Closing with Visually Salient Features,P. Newman and K. Ho,,2005,IEEE Abstract,635--642,,"Within the context of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), loop closing is the task of deciding whether or not a vehicle has, after an excursion of arbitrary length, returned to a previously visited area. Reliable loop closing is both essential and hard. It is without doubt one of the greatest impediments to long term, robust SLAM. This paper illustrates how visual features, used in conjunction with scanning laser data, can be used to a great advantage. We use the notion of visual saliency to focus the selection of suitable (affine invariant) image-feature descriptors for storage in a database. When queried with a recently taken image the database returns the capture time of matching images. This time information is used to discover loop closing events. Crucially this is achieved independently of estimated map and vehicle location. We integrate the above technique into a SLAM algorithm using delayed vehicle states and scan matching to form interpose geometric constraints.

We present SIVO (Semantically Informed Visual Odometry and Mapping), a novel information-theoretic feature selection method for visual SLAM which incorporates semantic segmentation and neural network uncertainty into the feature selection pipeline. Our algorithm selects points which provide the highest reduction in Shannon entropy between the entropy of the current state and the joint entropy of the state, given the addition of the new feature with the classification entropy of the feature from a Bayesian neural network. Each selected feature significantly reduces the uncertainty of the vehicle state and has been detected to be a static object (building, traffic sign, etc.) repeatedly with a high confidence. This selection strategy generates a sparse map which can facilitate long-term localization. The KITTI odometry dataset is used to evaluate our method, and we also compare our results against ORB_SLAM2.

In essence, we extract distinctive features from range measurements and bundle these into local views along with observation poses. The sensor's trajectory is then estimated in a sliding window fashion by matching current and old features and minimizing the distances in-between. The map representation facilitates finding a suitable set of old features, by selecting the closest local map(s) for matching. Similarly to a visibility analysis, this procedure provides a suitable set of features for localization but at a fraction of the computational cost. PoseMap also allows for updates and extensions of the map at any time by replacing and adding local maps when necessary. We evaluate our approach using two platforms both equipped with a 3D LiDAR and an IMU, demonstrating localization at 8 Hz and robustness to changes in the environment such as moving vehicles and changing vegetation.

,A metric approach for environments mapping,N. Slimane and M. S. Khireddine and K. Chafaa,,2013,IEEE Abstract,647--652,,"One of the main issues in mobile robotics is the autonomous navigation of a mobile robot in an unknown environment. Concurrent mapping and localisation or simultaneous localisation and mapping is a stochastic map building method which permits consistent robot navigation without requiring an a priori map. The governing idea which guides autonomous robotics consists in saying that the vehicle builds its chart progressively during exploration enabling it to evolve in the long term in unknown places in advance. When the robot environment chart is not known a priori, a generation module of incremental chart must obligatorily be integrated into the navigation system. The map is built incrementally as the robot observes the environment with its on-board sensors and, at the same time, is used to localise the robot. Unfortunately, the inaccuracy of the odometric sensors does not allow a sufficiently correct positioning of the robot. In this paper, simultaneous localisation and map building is performed with a metric approach which permits both precision and robustness. The most important innovation of the approach is the way how errors in the robot localisation control are handled by map building using the landmarks localisation information. The method uses data from a laser scanner to extract distances and orientations of landmarks and combines control localisation and metric paradigm. The metric approach, based on the Kalman filter, uses a new concept to avoid the problem of the drift in odometry.

Munich,,2019,IEEE Abstract,1--8,,"Occupancy mapping enables a mobile robot to make intelligent planning decisions to accomplish its tasks. Adaptive local maps is an algorithm which represents the occupancy information as a set of overlapping local maps anchored to poses in the robot's trajectory. At any time, a global occupancy map can be rendered from the local maps to be used for path planning. The advantage of this approach is that the occupancy information stays consistent despite the changes in the pose estimates resulting from loop closures and localization updates. The disadvantage, however, is that the number of local maps grows over time. For long robot runs, or for multiple runs in the same space, this growth will result in redundant occupancy information, which will in turn increase the time it takes to render the global map, as well as the memory footprint of the system.

Barfoot,,2016,IEEE Abstract,1918--1925,,"Vision-based, route-following algorithms enable autonomous robots to repeat manually taught paths over long distances using inexpensive vision sensors. However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for route-following applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day.

Steinbach,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2021,IEEE Abstract,2068--2075,6,"LiDAR-based odometry and mapping is used in many robotic applications to retrieve the robot's position in an unknown environment and allows for autonomous operation in GPS-denied (e.g., indoor) environments. With a 3D LiDAR sensor, highly accurate localization becomes possible, which enables high quality 3D reconstruction of the environment. In this letter we extend the well-known LOAM framework by leveraging prior knowledge about a reference object in the environment to further improve the localization accuracy. This requires a known 3D model of the reference object and its known position in a global coordinate frame. Instead of only relying on the point features in the mapping module of LOAM, we also include mesh features extracted from the 3D triangular mesh of the reference object in the optimization problem. For fast correspondence computation of mesh features, we use the Axis-Aligned-Bounding-Box-Tree (AABB) structure. Essentially, our approach not only makes use of the previously built map for absolute localization in the environment, but also takes the relative position to the reference object into account, effectively reducing long-term drift. To validate the proposed concept, we generated datasets using the Gazebo simulation environment in exemplary visual inspection scenarios of an airplane inside a hangar and the Eiffel Tower. An actuated 3D LiDAR sensor is mounted via a 1-DoF gimbal on a UAV capturing 360° scans. We benchmark our approach against the state-of-the-art open-source LOAM framework. The results show that the proposed joint optimization using both point and mesh features yields a significant reduction in Absolute Pose Error (APE) and therefore improves the map and 3D reconstruction quality during long-term operations.",,10.1109/LRA.2021.3060413,,,,Three-dimensional displays;Location awareness;Laser radar;Robot sensing systems;Optimization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Feature extraction;SLAM;localization;mapping;range sensing,,2377-3766,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,

However, with the growing time-spans and size of the areas we want to cover, appearance-based maps are often becoming too large to handle and are consisting of features that are not always reliable for localization purposes. This paper presents a method for selecting map features that are persistent over time and thus suited for long-term localization. Our methodology relies on a CNN classifier based on image patches and depth maps for recognizing which features are suitable for life-long matchability. Thus, the classifier not only considers the appearance of a feature but also takes into account its expected lifetime. As a result, our feature selection approach produces more compact maps with a high fraction of temporally-stable features compared to the current state-of-the-art, while rejecting unstable features that typically harm localization.

Sibley,,2015,IEEE Abstract,5487--5494,,"As robots continue to create long-term maps, the amount of information that they need to handle increases over time. In terms of place recognition, this implies that the number of images being considered may increase until exceeding the computational resources of the robot. In this paper we consider a scenario where, given multiple independent large maps, possibly from different cities or locations, a robot must effectively and in real time decide whether it can localize itself in one of those known maps. Since the number of images to be handled by such a system is likely to be extremely large, we find that it is beneficial to decompose the set of images into independent groups or environments. This raises a new question: Given a query image, how do we select the best environment? This paper proposes a similarity criterion that can be used to solve this problem. It is based on the observation that, if each environment is described in terms of its co-occurrent features, similarity between environments can be established by comparing their co-occurrence matrices. We show that this leads to a novel place recognition algorithm that divides the collection of images into environments and arranges them in a hierarchy of inverted indices. By selecting first the relevant environment for the operating robot, we can reduce the number of images to perform the actual loop detection, reducing the execution time while preserving the accuracy.

,Map Management for Efficient Long-Term Visual Localization in Outdoor Environments,M. Bürki and M. Dymczyk and I. Gilitschenski and C. Cadena and R. Siegwart and J. Nieto,,2018,IEEE Index Terms,682--688,,"We present a complete map management process for a visual localization system designed for multi-vehicle long-term operations in resource constrained outdoor environments. Outdoor visual localization generates large amounts of data that need to be incorporated into a lifelong visual map in order to allow localization at all times and under all appearance conditions. Processing these large quantities of data is non-trivial, as it is subject to limited computational and storage capabilities both on the vehicle and on the mapping backend. We address this problem with a two-fold map update paradigm capable of, either, adding new visual cues to the map, or updating co-observation statistics. The former, in combination with offline map summarization techniques, allows enhancing the appearance coverage of the lifelong map while keeping the map size limited. On the other hand, the latter is able to significantly boost the appearance-based landmark selection for efficient online localization without incurring any additional computational or storage burden. Our evaluation in challenging outdoor conditions shows that our proposed map management process allows building and maintaining maps for precise visual localization over long time spans in a tractable and scalable fashion.",,10.1109/IVS.2018.8500432,,,,Visualization;Buildings;Robot sensing systems;Autonomous automobiles;Maintenance engineering;Bandwidth;Intelligent vehicles,,1931-0587,,,,44698.62163,44698.62163,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
,Global localization using multiple hypothesis tracking: A real-world approach,M. Lutz and S. Hochdorfer and C. Schlegel,,2011,IEEE Abstract,127--132,,"Life-long and robust operation are important challenges to be solved towards everyday usability of service robots. Global localization is of particular interest for real-world applications. If a robot would not be able to relocalize itself within a known map, all positions stored by the robot (rooms, objects, etc.) would become obsolete. Although Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows to initially map new and unknown environments and to keep track of environmental changes, it does not solve the global localization problem. Each time SLAM is restarted at different locations, it introduces a new map and a new frame of reference. In this paper, we propose a solution to the global localization problem which uses a SLAM generated feature map. The approach is demonstrated with an omnicam and bearing-only features. A new way to weight hypotheses and to sort out false hypotheses results in fast convergence even with arbitrary relocalization paths. The combined approach is a further step towards life-long operation of service robots and covers every part of a robot lifecycle, ranging from a setup via SLAM to efficient global localization for reuse of maps and object poses after restart.",,10.1109/TEPRA.2011.5753494,,,,Simultaneous localization and mapping;Uncertainty;Robot kinematics;Kalman filters;Estimation,,2325-0534,,,,44698.62116,44698.62116,sousarbarb,,Unclassified,
