  abstract = {Cellular radio based localization can be an important complement or alternative to other localization technologies, as base stations continuously transmit signals of opportunity with beneficial positioning properties. In this paper, we use the long term evolution (LTE) cell-specific reference signal for this purpose. The multipath component delays are estimated by the ESPRIT algorithm, and the estimated multipath component delays of different snapshots are associated by global nearest neighbor with a Kalman filter. Rao-Blackwellized particle filter based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is then applied to estimate the position of user equipment and that of the base station and virtual transmitters. In a measurement campaign, data from one base station was logged, and the analysis based on the data shows that, at the end of the measurement, the SLAM performance is 11 meters better than that with only inertial measurement unit (IMU).},
